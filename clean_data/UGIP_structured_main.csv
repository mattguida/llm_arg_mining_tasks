414721643arg1,"As an devout atheist I strongly oppose this. It seems like some people don't understand that there IS  a seperation between church and state. Now I have to join the herd and recite a few words that mean nothing to me? We have something called a church that people do this in. So why is it in a public school?  Are we forgetting about those who may practice hinduism, buddhism, shintoism and other religions? What about them?  I don't care if the majority of people are Christains. SO! But since when do the majority decide what is best for everyone? Where are we in China now?  By the way, I thought as a good bunch of christains you were not suppose to mention thy lord's name in vain. CLAP CLAP Good for you.....NOT!

Therefore, requiring a statement of belief in a god is unconstitutionally preferring a majority religious belief over a minority one.

414721893arg6,"I myself being Catholic believe that the words 'under God' should not be included in a pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States. As is evident, the nation was based on ideals of religious freedom, and if somebody wishes to remain a patriot, pledging allegiance to their country, they should not be coerced to state something they don't believe to be true. Although a democratic government is based on majorities in the long run, in this case we very well may be violating the rights guaranteed to citizens via the Bill of Rights. The founding fathers, when constructing the constitution may have included references to their own religion, in this case Catholicism, but as we see a certain diversity being created in this past century, it is important to note that we as a nation should be more open to accept these different ideas to better suit all citizens. nnThat said, maybe it would have been easier to go along with the pledge that was first introduced which would have allowed for every citizen to feel their place in the country.",America is based on democracy and the pledge should reflect the belief of the American majority.,1

414721724arg3,I am whole hardly in favor of having Under God in the Pledge of Allegiance. We are a Christian nation founded on Biblical values since our inception. We must remain a Christian nation always and never stand devided as what is happening lately. We must value our Christian heritage and teach them to our children and grandchildren. The Aithiests have thier opinion but they are completely wrong in their way of thinking and they can`t change the fact that we were founded with Biblical values in the forefront by our founding father`s and they can`t change that no matter what they say. Thier opinion is flawed and they need the prayers of the Christian community so they can have a change of heart and let the light of Jesus to shine in their hearts and not oppose our Christian values and heritage and unite with us in a common cause to save the moral values of our nation or our nation will be lost to immorality and perversion with no sense of right and wrong.,Under God  is part of American tradition and history,5

At the same time however, how in our day and age, with such a diverse group of subcultures within our great country, can we allow something that blatantly disregards all other deities believed in by other Americans? Yes, the majority of Americans may believe in Catholicism and thus not have a problem with the phrase, but being selfless for a second, instead of self-centered, taking those two words out makes a bit of a difference to those who do not believe in that specific deity or any at all. And if we're being honest, why does it matter so much to keep it in?      Some might think, I want it in because I am a devout Christian (or whatever) and I want to represent that in my daily life. But, you know what, that's what churches and other places of worship are for.      Last time I checked, being proud to be an American meant being proud to embrace everything America is built on, namely diversity. We are supposed to be a melting pot of cultures, but with such a phrase, how can we call ourselves truly diverse?

If they wanted to establish a theocracy, they would have done so.  Instead, they insisted upon a wall of separation between church and state.   In every country and every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty.
