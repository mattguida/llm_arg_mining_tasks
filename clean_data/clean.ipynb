Believing in a religion is NOT required in America. Also, the under god in the pledge indicates a single god. What if you believe in many gods? What if you believe in an unbiased power? I believe in a god, however, I do not believe that under god needs to be in the pledge. If you are an atheist, you cannot pledge to a nation under god, because to you it does not exist. A theist however, can pledge to a nation. Don't you agree?\",\n",

Yes, there are lots of Christians in this country. Yes, their religion does fuel some of their actions.

Without 'under God' the pledge becomes a promise to support whatever the current policies of the government are. With 'under God' included, I can comfortably recite the pledge knowing that when the government adopts some policy that is contrary to the 'Laws of Nature and of Nature's God' I can reject the policy without breaking my promise. Unlimited allegiance to a state is not a good thing, as the historic examples of World War II show us. The United States is not guiltless on this score either. In my own life the government has carried laws on the books that were unfair to blacks, to women, to the native inhabitants of this continent. Our current policy on interrogation by torture of supposed enemy combatants seems to be another example. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The greatest danger to the exercise of any freedom, religious or otherwise, is the unchecked power of the organized state. The phrase 'under God' acts as a check on that authority.

The founding fathers specifically made a godless constitution and keeping god out of government it essential. Religion has a habit of incorporating cult activities and hatred for others outside their click. I also believe it was in 1948 that Louis bowman inserted, under God And then Eisenhower made it official in 1954. If I am not mistaken it was in response to the perceived threat of communism. The Christian Reich is constantly trying to state that the us was founded on their principles when it was not. In fact, the Christian clergy was dead set against Thomas Jefferson because of his views and statements on Christians. I think it was Thomas Paine who people called the father of the American revolution? Until he wrote a book on his beliefs of deism criticizing Christians. I believe it was called age of reason. Anyway after that Christians in their usual clickish way ostracized him and he died as an outcast. He was an extremely brilliant man. Just goes to show you why so many free thinkers crafted the constitution\",\n",

Before you claim to know the their intentions, please learn more about Jefferson, Franklin,  Paine.  Read their essays (you might be surprised how relevant their work still is - not to mention beautifully written).  Indeed, most of our founding fathers claimed membership in one sect of Christianity or another. But how does that help your argument?  If they wanted to establish a theocracy, they would have done so.  Instead, they insisted upon a wall of separation between church and state.   In every country and every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot...they have perverted the purest religion ever preached to man into mystery and jargon, unintelligible to all mankind, and therefore the safer for their purposes. -Jefferson  Note the purest religion, yet still insisted against its influence in gov.  As an (for lack of better word  brevity) athiest, how am I to feel when confronted with the choice of reciting that which I do not believe or remaining silent? Why exclude millions of Americans? I suspect you simply do not want us - your loss.',\n",
