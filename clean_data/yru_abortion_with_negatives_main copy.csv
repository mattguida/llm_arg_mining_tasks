If the supreme court agrees with abortions yet charge Peterson with two murders what are they thinking?!  Once the a egg is fertilized and starts to grow into a human body it has a human ""spirit"" or ""soul"" inside of it (for those who are religious).

So lets put a full grown man/women inside a glass incubator filled with water and have them semi-conscious.   And then lets put a drug in there to kill this person. Then, put a giant vacuum tube into the container and suck all there body parts out.  Is this murder?   Some people will say ""Oh well, that isn't the same. That person is fully developed and eduacated""  There is no difference between killing the grown body and that of a one inside a mother.  Weather it's there choice or not to get the abortion it IS still murder.  People should understand the consequences of having sex and abortion should not be a option. It leads to people saying ""Oh I can just get it aborted so I don't have to worry about it."" &lt;- LAZINESS.

ab327,"What? Ending a life isn't cruel? So i guess we should let murders and rapes takes place too because those are not cruel acts. Oh and i posted some information on the methods of abortion for you. These are the cruel methods stated again:  METHODS OF TERMNATION OF PREGNANCY  There are three abortion classificationsâsurgical abortion, medical abortion, and chemical abortion. They are defined as follows:  Surgical abortion: These are abortions that involve an invasive procedure. Major types of surgical abortions include:   Suction aspiration: This is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). The abortionist inserts a suction tube (similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end) into the mother's womb. The suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle.   Dilation and curettage (D&C;): In this procedure, the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall. The baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb.   Dilation and extraction (also known as D&X;or partial-birth abortion): Used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old), the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb, grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother, except for the head. The abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull. The abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out. The forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way.   Dilation and evacuation (D&E;): This form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). The abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart. The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth.   Hysterotomy: Performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby. The baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse.   Medical abortions: These are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child. Common drugs used for medical abortions include:  Mifepristone (RU-486): Mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). This lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby. The tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug, misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb.   Methotrexate: this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells. It also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive. When the systems fail, the baby dies. Misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb.   Salt poisoning: This technique is used in the second and third trimester. The abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb. The needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. The baby breathes in, swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning, dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions. Taking nearly an hour to die, the baby's skin is completely burned, turns red and deteriorates. The baby is in pain the entire time. The mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby.   Prostaglandins: Used during the second and third trimester, prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac, causing violent premature labor. During these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving.   Chemical abortions: These are abortions caused by drugs that, at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining. Some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are:   The Ortho-EvraÂ® birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (Physicians' Desk Reference. 60 ed. Montvale, NJ: Thompson PDR; 2006. 2402).   The NuvaRingÂ® vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (PDR. 2357).  Depo-ProveraÂ® Contraceptive Injection, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect (PDR 2620).

Oh and i posted some information on the methods of abortion for you. These are the cruel methods stated again:  METHODS OF TERMNATION OF PREGNANCY  There are three abortion classificationsâsurgical abortion, medical abortion, and chemical abortion. They are defined as follows:  Surgical abortion: These are abortions that involve an invasive procedure. Major types of surgical abortions include:   Suction aspiration: This is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). The abortionist inserts a suction tube (similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end) into the mother's womb. The suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle.   Dilation and curettage (D&C;): In this procedure, the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall. The baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb.   Dilation and extraction (also known as D&X;or partial-birth abortion): Used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old), the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb, grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother, except for the head. The abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull. The abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out. The forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way.   Dilation and evacuation (D&E;): This form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). The abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart. The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth.   Hysterotomy: Performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby. The baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse.   Medical abortions: These are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child. Common drugs used for medical abortions include:  Mifepristone (RU-486): Mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). This lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby. The tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug, misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb.   Methotrexate: this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells. It also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive. When the systems fail, the baby dies. Misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb.   Salt poisoning: This technique is used in the second and third trimester. The abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb. The needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. The baby breathes in, swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning, dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions. Taking nearly an hour to die, the baby's skin is completely burned, turns red and deteriorates. The baby is in pain the entire time. The mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby.   Prostaglandins: Used during the second and third trimester, prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac, causing violent premature labor. During these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving.   Chemical abortions: These are abortions caused by drugs that, at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining. Some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are:   The Ortho-EvraÂ® birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (Physicians' Desk Reference. 60 ed. Montvale, NJ: Thompson PDR; 2006. 2402).   The NuvaRingÂ® vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (PDR. 2357).  Depo-ProveraÂ® Contraceptive Injection, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect (PDR 2620).

The baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb.   Dilation and extraction (also known as D&X;or partial-birth abortion): Used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old), the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb, grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother, except for the head. The abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull. The abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out. The forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way.   Dilation and evacuation (D&E;): This form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). The abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart. The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth.   Hysterotomy: Performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby. The baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse.   Medical abortions: These are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child. Common drugs used for medical abortions include:  Mifepristone (RU-486): Mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). This lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby. The tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug, misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb.   Methotrexate: this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells. It also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive. When the systems fail, the baby dies. Misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb.   Salt poisoning: This technique is used in the second and third trimester. The abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb. The needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. The baby breathes in, swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning, dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions. Taking nearly an hour to die, the baby's skin is completely burned, turns red and deteriorates. The baby is in pain the entire time. The mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby.   Prostaglandins: Used during the second and third trimester, prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac, causing violent premature labor. During these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving.   Chemical abortions: These are abortions caused by drugs that, at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining. Some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are:   The Ortho-EvraÂ® birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (Physicians' Desk Reference. 60 ed. Montvale, NJ: Thompson PDR; 2006. 2402).   The NuvaRingÂ® vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (PDR. 2357).  Depo-ProveraÂ® Contraceptive Injection, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect (PDR 2620).   Plan BÂ® is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization, by altering the tubal transport of sperm and/or ova. In addition, it may inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium (PDR 1068",p-sick_mom,0,ab327arg7

Oh and i posted some information on the methods of abortion for you. These are the cruel methods stated again:  METHODS OF TERMNATION OF PREGNANCY  There are three abortion classificationsâsurgical abortion, medical abortion, and chemical abortion. They are defined as follows:  Surgical abortion: These are abortions that involve an invasive procedure. Major types of surgical abortions include:   Suction aspiration: This is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months).

The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth.   Hysterotomy: Performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby. The baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse.   Medical abortions: These are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child. Common drugs used for medical abortions include:  Mifepristone (RU-486): Mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). This lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby. The tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug, misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb.   Methotrexate: this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells. It also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive. When the systems fail, the baby dies. Misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb.   Salt poisoning: This technique is used in the second and third trimester. The abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb. The needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. The baby breathes in, swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning, dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions. Taking nearly an hour to die, the baby's skin is completely burned, turns red and deteriorates. The baby is in pain the entire time. The mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby.   Prostaglandins: Used during the second and third trimester, prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac, causing violent premature labor. During these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving.   Chemical abortions: These are abortions caused by drugs that, at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining. Some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are:   The Ortho-EvraÂ® birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (Physicians' Desk Reference. 60 ed. Montvale, NJ: Thompson PDR; 2006. 2402).   The NuvaRingÂ® vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (PDR. 2357).  Depo-ProveraÂ® Contraceptive Injection, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect (PDR 2620).   Plan BÂ® is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization, by altering the tubal transport of sperm and/or ova. In addition, it may inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium (PDR 1068",c-bad_4_mom,0,ab327arg13
ab327,"What? Ending a life isn't cruel? So i guess we should let murders and rapes takes place too because those are not cruel acts. Oh and i posted some information on the methods of abortion for you. These are the cruel methods stated again:  METHODS OF TERMNATION OF PREGNANCY  There are three abortion classificationsâsurgical abortion, medical abortion, and chemical abortion. They are defined as follows:  Surgical abortion: These are abortions that involve an invasive procedure. Major types of surgical abortions include:   Suction aspiration: This is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). The abortionist inserts a suction tube (similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end) into the mother's womb. The suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle.   Dilation and curettage (D&C;): In this procedure, the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall. The baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb.   Dilation and extraction (also known as D&X;or partial-birth abortion): Used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old), the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb, grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother, except for the head. The abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull. The abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out. The forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way.   Dilation and evacuation (D&E;): This form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). The abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart. The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth.   Hysterotomy: Performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby.

And rape......in your opinion it is wrong...but what about other cultures?   And Hitler, he killed those who thought inferior and weak. Murder has always existed. But peoples opinions differ on whether the murders are warrented. There are those who think our participation in the ME wars were wrong that they served no good. Others disagree.

ab35,"So the laws say that a woman should not use her body for the purpose of prositution. So would you say that the laws are infringing upon the body of the woman?   Check up the details of science. A human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species (Homo sapiens) living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the same species (Homo sapiens) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically dependent on the mother). This homospecific relationship is an obligatory dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship. A parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. When a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.   When the human embryo or fetus attaches to and invades the lining tissue of the mother's uterus, the lining tissue responds by surrounding the human embryo and does not cut it off from the mother, but rather establishes a means of close contact (the placenta) between the mother and the new human being.  New evidence, presented by Beer and Billingham in their article, ""The Embryo as a Transplant"" (Scientific American, April, 1974), indicates that the mother does react to the presence of the embryo by producing humoral antibodies, but they suggest that the trophoblast -- the jacket of cells surrounding the embryo -- blocks the action of these antibodies and therefore the embryo or fetus is not rejected. This reaction is unique to the embryo-mother relationship.  Abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about. What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries. You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life.

Humans obtain their inalienable rights purely by being a human being. From the moment of conception, a distinct human being, with its own unique genetic signature, has been given rise - thus from the moment of conception a human being starts to exist and as such, with conception the inalienable rights are also given to the human merely for existing as a human being.  2. We start bartering and haggling. When does a human get rights, what rights, which humans should get them etc etc. But if we conclude with this option, then there is no real reason to limit ourselves to the unborn - Nazi Germany is a very modern example of a nation haggling with these inalienable rights on born human beings.  So first of all, we need to see what implications rise from the views and ideas to which we have attached ourselves to.  Now that you've thought about these implications, lets look at abortion from an honest perspective - it's the termination of the life of a developing human being for the sake of perserving the convenience and the satisfaction of another person. This is against all reason. Convenience does not justify the termination of another human's life - murder.  The parents are generally always responsible for the creation of the fetus, so they should have the moral obligation to support the life of that fetus. If they do not want the child, they can give him/her up for adoption - adoption is not some myth. We must also strive for the creation of institutions that would take care of unwanted children in a loving, productive environment. Murder is not an acceptable alternative for a civilized nation.  Given the fact that pregnancy lasts 9 months, one needs to ask themselves - Is murder justified by temporary inconvenience?  For the sake of comparison, think of the USA, 1800 - the question of slavery. Some of you may object, but the general rethoric at the time was completely the same - Blacks are not fully human, thus they have no rights ; We should not force our opinions on other people, lets respect our freedom to choose ; We are not ready for such an extensive protection of human rights, we need to go step by step etc etc.   Nowaydays we laugh and ridicule such arguments as we see it self-evidently that slavery is immoral and I'm convinced that 100 years from now, we'll be seeing abortion in the same light.

The statement Reagan made is true. We are given life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in our Constitutionâ¦.but without life we can't have the others.

ab371,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM. He does not even have to know, even if he is the father. If he was recognized as a player...the law would not be what it is today. Nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either. That is the law.  The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ¦.she took the risk.  The sperm leaves his body...and enters her. His part is done. The sperm was a gift, he certainly canât ask for it back can he? LOL She holds the cards and has him by the you know what...that is if he wants the baby, because whether he wants it or not.......itâs NOT AN ISSUE.    Of course I am a Christian and don't believe it should be this way, but that is the law today.     I believe personally that the man should be considered....that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion. Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs.     You said itâs unfair........why? You are trying to make yourself feel better look better. You are pro-choice and believe the option should be there remember. Consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing.  You said, âIt's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.â?  Am I calling names? Didnât you call me a pig? Better reread that section. Am I insulting you because you are pro-abortion? Well gee I am sorry, the truth hurts. You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   Now if the way I described it sounds crassâ¦sorry, but I was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made. Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.     As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in. Is that better way to put it?     You are absolutely unbelievable. You want to blameâ¦â¦and blame you do, for what is a womanâs issue, so says the law. What do you not get? Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy? NO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS NO. HE IS NOT AN ISSUE and HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE.     As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that. I work with women who have had abortionsâ¦.because I know what itâs like, I had one. I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be. So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through. The work I do is in this field, I see the pain, especially afterwards. And guess whatâ¦â¦â¦..the pain is just not experienced by the woman, but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children. The woman calls the shots as I did when I had mine some thirty years ago. I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill. Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâs ovensâ¦ pro-life? How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?  And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?  Of course you will retaliateâ¦you condone abortion which is violence.     You ranted onâ¦â¦âYou are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she should have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.â?  I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull? If someone drives someone to a robberyâ¦.and they are caughtâ¦.does the police just sayâ¦.ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye? I mean come on. If you refused to take her to the abortion, she might not get it. If the doctor didnât show up, the nurse refuse to do itâ¦the baby might have a chance.   You said, â Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.â?  Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny. Bolongaâ¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ¦.not just because of pain. Insult? Retaliation, isnât that what itâs all about, you said so yourself didnât you? Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ¦â¦â¦? LOL Oh yes because I am a Christian, right. Am I supposed to just sing kum ba yah around a campfire and shutup, not stand up for the things THAT ARE UNCHRISTIAN? No case for abortion can be made scripturally. Christ would want me to stand up the his little children, he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin, devastated my life until I came to Him. So you donât like how I put thingsâ¦â¦..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.  I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth. You might be the greatest person in the world, but you are pro-abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice. you are not for and against....you are for......because you think it should be legal.     You said,â Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.â?  I said, if a woman and man are marriedâ¦â¦he cannot stop her from killing their child by abortion. He has no rights even though it is his child. BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION. She calls the shots.  Now if they were not married, she canât hold him financially accountable for anything. The baby is hers, unless she puts his name on the birth certificateâ¦and in that case he might for forced to pay.   You said, âWhat? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that is the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you. Which is where I get my opinion on when I think abortion is okay.â?  Well you are wrong againâ¦.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ James_Elgin_Gill    128 days earlyâ¦ or 21 weeks 5 days early  Then there was Amillia Taylor who is also often cited as the most-premature baby. She was born on 24 October 2006 in Miami, Florida, at 21 weeks and 6 days gestation. At birth she was 9 inches (23 cm) long and weighed 10 ounces (283 grams). She suffered digestive and respiratory problems, together with a brain hemorrhage. She was discharged from the Baptist Children's Hospital on 20 February 2007.  There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.     I know the information out thereâ¦you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Pain is not an issueâ¦.personhood is and you do not give the fetus any personhood at all.  âIf I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?""  You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????  Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?",p-right,0,ab371arg0
ab371,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM. He does not even have to know, even if he is the father. If he was recognized as a player...the law would not be what it is today. Nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either. That is the law.  The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ¦.she took the risk.  The sperm leaves his body...and enters her. His part is done. The sperm was a gift, he certainly canât ask for it back can he? LOL She holds the cards and has him by the you know what...that is if he wants the baby, because whether he wants it or not.......itâs NOT AN ISSUE.    Of course I am a Christian and don't believe it should be this way, but that is the law today.     I believe personally that the man should be considered....that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion. Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs.     You said itâs unfair........why? You are trying to make yourself feel better look better. You are pro-choice and believe the option should be there remember. Consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing.  You said, âIt's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.â?  Am I calling names? Didnât you call me a pig? Better reread that section. Am I insulting you because you are pro-abortion? Well gee I am sorry, the truth hurts. You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   Now if the way I described it sounds crassâ¦sorry, but I was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made. Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.     As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in. Is that better way to put it?     You are absolutely unbelievable. You want to blameâ¦â¦and blame you do, for what is a womanâs issue, so says the law. What do you not get? Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy? NO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS NO. HE IS NOT AN ISSUE and HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE.     As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that. I work with women who have had abortionsâ¦.because I know what itâs like, I had one. I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be. So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through. The work I do is in this field, I see the pain, especially afterwards. And guess whatâ¦â¦â¦..the pain is just not experienced by the woman, but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children. The woman calls the shots as I did when I had mine some thirty years ago. I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way.

Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny. Bolongaâ¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ¦.not just because of pain. Insult? Retaliation, isnât that what itâs all about, you said so yourself didnât you? Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ¦â¦â¦? LOL Oh yes because I am a Christian, right. Am I supposed to just sing kum ba yah around a campfire and shutup, not stand up for the things THAT ARE UNCHRISTIAN? No case for abortion can be made scripturally. Christ would want me to stand up the his little children, he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin, devastated my life until I came to Him. So you donât like how I put thingsâ¦â¦..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.  I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth. You might be the greatest person in the world, but you are pro-abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice. you are not for and against....you are for......because you think it should be legal.     You said,â Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.â?  I said, if a woman and man are marriedâ¦â¦he cannot stop her from killing their child by abortion. He has no rights even though it is his child. BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION. She calls the shots.  Now if they were not married, she canât hold him financially accountable for anything. The baby is hers, unless she puts his name on the birth certificateâ¦and in that case he might for forced to pay.   You said, âWhat? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that is the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you. Which is where I get my opinion on when I think abortion is okay.â?  Well you are wrong againâ¦.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ James_Elgin_Gill    128 days earlyâ¦ or 21 weeks 5 days early  Then there was Amillia Taylor who is also often cited as the most-premature baby. She was born on 24 October 2006 in Miami, Florida, at 21 weeks and 6 days gestation. At birth she was 9 inches (23 cm) long and weighed 10 ounces (283 grams). She suffered digestive and respiratory problems, together with a brain hemorrhage. She was discharged from the Baptist Children's Hospital on 20 February 2007.  There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.     I know the information out thereâ¦you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Pain is not an issueâ¦.personhood is and you do not give the fetus any personhood at all.  âIf I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?""  You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????  Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?",p-mother_danger,0,ab371arg3
ab371,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM. He does not even have to know, even if he is the father. If he was recognized as a player...the law would not be what it is today. Nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either. That is the law.  The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ¦.she took the risk.  The sperm leaves his body...and enters her. His part is done. The sperm was a gift, he certainly canât ask for it back can he? LOL She holds the cards and has him by the you know what...that is if he wants the baby, because whether he wants it or not.......itâs NOT AN ISSUE.    Of course I am a Christian and don't believe it should be this way, but that is the law today.     I believe personally that the man should be considered....that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion. Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs.     You said itâs unfair........why? You are trying to make yourself feel better look better. You are pro-choice and believe the option should be there remember. Consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing.  You said, âIt's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.â?  Am I calling names? Didnât you call me a pig? Better reread that section. Am I insulting you because you are pro-abortion? Well gee I am sorry, the truth hurts. You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   Now if the way I described it sounds crassâ¦sorry, but I was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made. Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.     As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in. Is that better way to put it?     You are absolutely unbelievable. You want to blameâ¦â¦and blame you do, for what is a womanâs issue, so says the law. What do you not get? Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy? NO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS NO. HE IS NOT AN ISSUE and HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE.     As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that. I work with women who have had abortionsâ¦.because I know what itâs like, I had one. I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be. So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through. The work I do is in this field, I see the pain, especially afterwards. And guess whatâ¦â¦â¦..the pain is just not experienced by the woman, but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children. The woman calls the shots as I did when I had mine some thirty years ago. I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill. Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâs ovensâ¦ pro-life? How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?  And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?  Of course you will retaliateâ¦you condone abortion which is violence.     You ranted onâ¦â¦âYou are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she should have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.â?  I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull? If someone drives someone to a robberyâ¦.and they are caughtâ¦.does the police just sayâ¦.ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye? I mean come on. If you refused to take her to the abortion, she might not get it. If the doctor didnât show up, the nurse refuse to do itâ¦the baby might have a chance.   You said, â Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are.

She was born on 24 October 2006 in Miami, Florida, at 21 weeks and 6 days gestation. At birth she was 9 inches (23 cm) long and weighed 10 ounces (283 grams). She suffered digestive and respiratory problems, together with a brain hemorrhage. She was discharged from the Baptist Children's Hospital on 20 February 2007.  There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.     I know the information out thereâ¦you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.

ab371,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM. He does not even have to know, even if he is the father. If he was recognized as a player...the law would not be what it is today. Nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either. That is the law.  The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ¦.she took the risk.  The sperm leaves his body...and enters her. His part is done. The sperm was a gift, he certainly canât ask for it back can he? LOL She holds the cards and has him by the you know what...that is if he wants the baby, because whether he wants it or not.......itâs NOT AN ISSUE.    Of course I am a Christian and don't believe it should be this way, but that is the law today.     I believe personally that the man should be considered....that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion. Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs.     You said itâs unfair........why? You are trying to make yourself feel better look better. You are pro-choice and believe the option should be there remember. Consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing.  You said, âIt's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.â?  Am I calling names? Didnât you call me a pig? Better reread that section. Am I insulting you because you are pro-abortion? Well gee I am sorry, the truth hurts. You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   Now if the way I described it sounds crassâ¦sorry, but I was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made. Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.     As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in. Is that better way to put it?     You are absolutely unbelievable. You want to blameâ¦â¦and blame you do, for what is a womanâs issue, so says the law. What do you not get? Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy? NO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS NO. HE IS NOT AN ISSUE and HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE.     As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that. I work with women who have had abortionsâ¦.because I know what itâs like, I had one. I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be. So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through. The work I do is in this field, I see the pain, especially afterwards. And guess whatâ¦â¦â¦..the pain is just not experienced by the woman, but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children. The woman calls the shots as I did when I had mine some thirty years ago. I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill. Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâs ovensâ¦ pro-life? How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?  And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?  Of course you will retaliateâ¦you condone abortion which is violence.     You ranted onâ¦â¦âYou are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she should have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.â?  I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull? If someone drives someone to a robberyâ¦.and they are caughtâ¦.does the police just sayâ¦.ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye? I mean come on. If you refused to take her to the abortion, she might not get it. If the doctor didnât show up, the nurse refuse to do itâ¦the baby might have a chance.   You said, â Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.â?  Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny. Bolongaâ¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ¦.not just because of pain. Insult? Retaliation, isnât that what itâs all about, you said so yourself didnât you? Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ¦â¦â¦? LOL Oh yes because I am a Christian, right. Am I supposed to just sing kum ba yah around a campfire and shutup, not stand up for the things THAT ARE UNCHRISTIAN? No case for abortion can be made scripturally. Christ would want me to stand up the his little children, he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin, devastated my life until I came to Him. So you donât like how I put thingsâ¦â¦..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.  I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth. You might be the greatest person in the world, but you are pro-abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice. you are not for and against....you are for......because you think it should be legal.     You said,â Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.â?  I said, if a woman and man are marriedâ¦â¦he cannot stop her from killing their child by abortion. He has no rights even though it is his child. BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION. She calls the shots.  Now if they were not married, she canât hold him financially accountable for anything.

He does not even have to know, even if he is the father. If he was recognized as a player...the law would not be what it is today. Nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either. That is the law.  The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ¦.she took the risk.  The sperm leaves his body...and enters her. His part is done. The sperm was a gift, he certainly canât ask for it back can he? LOL She holds the cards and has him by the you know what...that is if he wants the baby, because whether he wants it or not.......itâs NOT AN ISSUE.    Of course I am a Christian and don't believe it should be this way, but that is the law today.     I believe personally that the man should be considered....that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion. Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs.     You said itâs unfair........why? You are trying to make yourself feel better look better. You are pro-choice and believe the option should be there remember. Consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing.  You said, âIt's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.â?  Am I calling names? Didnât you call me a pig? Better reread that section. Am I insulting you because you are pro-abortion? Well gee I am sorry, the truth hurts. You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   Now if the way I described it sounds crassâ¦sorry, but I was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made. Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.     As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in. Is that better way to put it?     You are absolutely unbelievable. You want to blameâ¦â¦and blame you do, for what is a womanâs issue, so says the law. What do you not get? Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy? NO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS NO. HE IS NOT AN ISSUE and HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE.     As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that. I work with women who have had abortionsâ¦.because I know what itâs like, I had one. I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be. So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through. The work I do is in this field, I see the pain, especially afterwards. And guess whatâ¦â¦â¦..the pain is just not experienced by the woman, but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children. The woman calls the shots as I did when I had mine some thirty years ago. I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill. Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâs ovensâ¦ pro-life? How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?  And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?  Of course you will retaliateâ¦you condone abortion which is violence.     You ranted onâ¦â¦âYou are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she should have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.â?  I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull? If someone drives someone to a robberyâ¦.and they are caughtâ¦.does the police just sayâ¦.ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye? I mean come on. If you refused to take her to the abortion, she might not get it. If the doctor didnât show up, the nurse refuse to do itâ¦the baby might have a chance.   You said, â Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.â?  Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny. Bolongaâ¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ¦.not just because of pain. Insult? Retaliation, isnât that what itâs all about, you said so yourself didnât you? Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ¦â¦â¦? LOL Oh yes because I am a Christian, right. Am I supposed to just sing kum ba yah around a campfire and shutup, not stand up for the things THAT ARE UNCHRISTIAN? No case for abortion can be made scripturally. Christ would want me to stand up the his little children, he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin, devastated my life until I came to Him. So you donât like how I put thingsâ¦â¦..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.  I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth. You might be the greatest person in the world, but you are pro-abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice. you are not for and against....you are for......because you think it should be legal.     You said,â Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.â?  I said, if a woman and man are marriedâ¦â¦he cannot stop her from killing their child by abortion. He has no rights even though it is his child. BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION. She calls the shots.  Now if they were not married, she canât hold him financially accountable for anything. The baby is hers, unless she puts his name on the birth certificateâ¦and in that case he might for forced to pay.   You said, âWhat? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that is the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you.

Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.     As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in. Is that better way to put it?     You are absolutely unbelievable. You want to blameâ¦â¦and blame you do, for what is a womanâs issue, so says the law. What do you not get? Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy? NO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS NO. HE IS NOT AN ISSUE and HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE.     As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that. I work with women who have had abortionsâ¦.because I know what itâs like, I had one. I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be. So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through. The work I do is in this field, I see the pain, especially afterwards. And guess whatâ¦â¦â¦..the pain is just not experienced by the woman, but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children. The woman calls the shots as I did when I had mine some thirty years ago. I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill. Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâs ovensâ¦ pro-life? How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?  And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?  Of course you will retaliateâ¦you condone abortion which is violence.     You ranted onâ¦â¦âYou are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she should have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.â?  I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull? If someone drives someone to a robberyâ¦.and they are caughtâ¦.does the police just sayâ¦.ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye? I mean come on. If you refused to take her to the abortion, she might not get it. If the doctor didnât show up, the nurse refuse to do itâ¦the baby might have a chance.   You said, â Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.â?  Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny. Bolongaâ¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ¦.not just because of pain. Insult? Retaliation, isnât that what itâs all about, you said so yourself didnât you? Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ¦â¦â¦? LOL Oh yes because I am a Christian, right. Am I supposed to just sing kum ba yah around a campfire and shutup, not stand up for the things THAT ARE UNCHRISTIAN? No case for abortion can be made scripturally. Christ would want me to stand up the his little children, he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin, devastated my life until I came to Him. So you donât like how I put thingsâ¦â¦..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.  I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth. You might be the greatest person in the world, but you are pro-abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice. you are not for and against....you are for......because you think it should be legal.     You said,â Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.â?  I said, if a woman and man are marriedâ¦â¦he cannot stop her from killing their child by abortion. He has no rights even though it is his child. BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION. She calls the shots.  Now if they were not married, she canât hold him financially accountable for anything. The baby is hers, unless she puts his name on the birth certificateâ¦and in that case he might for forced to pay.   You said, âWhat? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that is the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you. Which is where I get my opinion on when I think abortion is okay.â?  Well you are wrong againâ¦.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ James_Elgin_Gill    128 days earlyâ¦ or 21 weeks 5 days early  Then there was Amillia Taylor who is also often cited as the most-premature baby. She was born on 24 October 2006 in Miami, Florida, at 21 weeks and 6 days gestation. At birth she was 9 inches (23 cm) long and weighed 10 ounces (283 grams). She suffered digestive and respiratory problems, together with a brain hemorrhage. She was discharged from the Baptist Children's Hospital on 20 February 2007.  There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.     I know the information out thereâ¦you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Pain is not an issueâ¦.personhood is and you do not give the fetus any personhood at all.  âIf I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?""  You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????  Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?",c-bad_4_mom,1,ab371arg13
ab371,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM. He does not even have to know, even if he is the father. If he was recognized as a player...the law would not be what it is today. Nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either. That is the law.  The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ¦.she took the risk.  The sperm leaves his body...and enters her. His part is done. The sperm was a gift, he certainly canât ask for it back can he? LOL She holds the cards and has him by the you know what...that is if he wants the baby, because whether he wants it or not.......itâs NOT AN ISSUE.    Of course I am a Christian and don't believe it should be this way, but that is the law today.     I believe personally that the man should be considered....that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion. Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs.     You said itâs unfair........why? You are trying to make yourself feel better look better. You are pro-choice and believe the option should be there remember. Consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing.  You said, âIt's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.â?  Am I calling names? Didnât you call me a pig? Better reread that section. Am I insulting you because you are pro-abortion? Well gee I am sorry, the truth hurts. You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   Now if the way I described it sounds crassâ¦sorry, but I was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made.

ab379,"How can the body of a woman be infringed upon when a woman knows the result of sexual intercourse is a fetus?   When she is prevented from dealing with her body as she sees fit, her rights to her own body are being infringed upon. This is self-evident and if you disagree you are going to have to explain yourself.    You are failing to understand that a parasite can only be from the animal kingdom and not the human kingdom because the fetus itself is from the family of homo sapiens. A parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury. There is no proof of that in a fetus. For a parasitic relationship, those elements of science have to exist.   There is no such thing as a 'human kingdom'. Humans are as much a part of the animal kingdom as cats, chimps, and mice.   Do not assume I don't understand what you are trying to say. It just irrelevant. Regardless of species, the fetus leeches nutrients from the mother and does not return them. Again, this is a parasitic relationship: one organism leeches from another without returning anything. Some definitions include the stipulation of separate species, and others do not. But either way, you cannot possibly argue that the fetus has anything to contribute to the biological relationship. It only takes, it does not return. The claim that pregnancy causes no injury to the woman leads me to believe you have never even spoken to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy is  extremely  taxing on the mother's body, even in environments where she has no shortage of food and does not need to be active. It often leads to malnutrition, anemia, or high blood pressure, and even when it doesn't do any of these things, it is still exhausting, painful, and their bodies will never be the same. This is technically injury to the woman, even though in some cases it may be minor, and is completely natural. If a woman were to be forced to endure a pregnancy based on what someone else think she should do with her body, I am sure the mental toll would also be enormous.    But a mother should not recuse herself from the birth of her fetus when the fetus contains her DNA and is equivalent to murder. Murder is the intentional taking of a human life which in this case refers to abortion itself as well.   You are studying law and you are trying to say abortion is legally murder? A fetus is not legally considered a human life and so it cannot fit the definition of murder as you are using it.   The fetus having possession of the mother's DNA has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not it is murder. Your skin cells have your DNA but you are not committing murder when you scratch yourself. This point is also of subjective importance; don't assume that what matters to you is what matters to everyone.  Even if I did consider a fetus to be a human life, I still maintain that the mother's rights override the rights of the fetus. I would be ashamed to live in a country that forced unwilling mothers to incubate babies they didn't want, effectively reducing them to subhumans whose bodies were at the mercy of someone else's whims. This sounds like a nightmare. The government has no right to tell you or any other citizen what medical procedures they  must  undergo or what medical procedures they  may not  undergo.    If a mother chooses not to take care of her child after she gives birth to it, she can be criminally prosecuted for criminal negligence.   The reason the mother is and should be culpable is that, at that point, the child  can  depend on someone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  able  to someone who will care for the child. Before the fetus is viable, it  cannot  depend on anyone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  unable  to find anyone else who will finish the pregnancy for her. Abortion is currently the only option for women who do not want to remain pregnant; if there were some way to remove the fetus and put it in the body of a willing surrogate, I would be all for this.     And if she chooses to give the child away for abortion, then the child will still need the help of another foster mother for survival.   Since this is nonsense, I am going to assume you mean 'adoption' instead of 'abortion'. This does not change a single thing about my argument; at this point, the child can depend on someone but its biological mother for survival, so abortion is not necessary if the biological mother no longer wants to care for it.  --  In addition to my previous point, I would like to pose a hypothetical situation. Someone has a child. When their child is 10 years old, he becomes gravely ill. Only an organ transplant will save him. Unfortunately, the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents. For whatever reason, the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs. Should the government get involved and  force  one of the parents to give the child an organ, under threat of punishment? If yes, why draw the line at a parent-child situation? Why not force every citizen to have their unnecessary organs surgically removed and given to people on the donor list? If no, why not? After all, the humanhood and citizenship of people on the organ list is not even under debate, and you have shown you think it is okay to force people to conserve life/a living human at the expense of their own bodies.",p-right,1,ab379arg0

ab379,"How can the body of a woman be infringed upon when a woman knows the result of sexual intercourse is a fetus?   When she is prevented from dealing with her body as she sees fit, her rights to her own body are being infringed upon. This is self-evident and if you disagree you are going to have to explain yourself.    You are failing to understand that a parasite can only be from the animal kingdom and not the human kingdom because the fetus itself is from the family of homo sapiens. A parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury. There is no proof of that in a fetus. For a parasitic relationship, those elements of science have to exist.   There is no such thing as a 'human kingdom'. Humans are as much a part of the animal kingdom as cats, chimps, and mice.   Do not assume I don't understand what you are trying to say. It just irrelevant. Regardless of species, the fetus leeches nutrients from the mother and does not return them. Again, this is a parasitic relationship: one organism leeches from another without returning anything. Some definitions include the stipulation of separate species, and others do not. But either way, you cannot possibly argue that the fetus has anything to contribute to the biological relationship. It only takes, it does not return. The claim that pregnancy causes no injury to the woman leads me to believe you have never even spoken to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy is  extremely  taxing on the mother's body, even in environments where she has no shortage of food and does not need to be active. It often leads to malnutrition, anemia, or high blood pressure, and even when it doesn't do any of these things, it is still exhausting, painful, and their bodies will never be the same. This is technically injury to the woman, even though in some cases it may be minor, and is completely natural. If a woman were to be forced to endure a pregnancy based on what someone else think she should do with her body, I am sure the mental toll would also be enormous.    But a mother should not recuse herself from the birth of her fetus when the fetus contains her DNA and is equivalent to murder. Murder is the intentional taking of a human life which in this case refers to abortion itself as well.   You are studying law and you are trying to say abortion is legally murder? A fetus is not legally considered a human life and so it cannot fit the definition of murder as you are using it.   The fetus having possession of the mother's DNA has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not it is murder. Your skin cells have your DNA but you are not committing murder when you scratch yourself. This point is also of subjective importance; don't assume that what matters to you is what matters to everyone.  Even if I did consider a fetus to be a human life, I still maintain that the mother's rights override the rights of the fetus. I would be ashamed to live in a country that forced unwilling mothers to incubate babies they didn't want, effectively reducing them to subhumans whose bodies were at the mercy of someone else's whims. This sounds like a nightmare. The government has no right to tell you or any other citizen what medical procedures they  must  undergo or what medical procedures they  may not  undergo.    If a mother chooses not to take care of her child after she gives birth to it, she can be criminally prosecuted for criminal negligence.   The reason the mother is and should be culpable is that, at that point, the child  can  depend on someone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  able  to someone who will care for the child. Before the fetus is viable, it  cannot  depend on anyone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  unable  to find anyone else who will finish the pregnancy for her. Abortion is currently the only option for women who do not want to remain pregnant; if there were some way to remove the fetus and put it in the body of a willing surrogate, I would be all for this.     And if she chooses to give the child away for abortion, then the child will still need the help of another foster mother for survival.   Since this is nonsense, I am going to assume you mean 'adoption' instead of 'abortion'. This does not change a single thing about my argument; at this point, the child can depend on someone but its biological mother for survival, so abortion is not necessary if the biological mother no longer wants to care for it.  --  In addition to my previous point, I would like to pose a hypothetical situation. Someone has a child. When their child is 10 years old, he becomes gravely ill. Only an organ transplant will save him. Unfortunately, the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents. For whatever reason, the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs.

A fetus is not legally considered a human life and so it cannot fit the definition of murder as you are using it.   The fetus having possession of the mother's DNA has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not it is murder. Your skin cells have your DNA but you are not committing murder when you scratch yourself. This point is also of subjective importance; don't assume that what matters to you is what matters to everyone.  Even if I did consider a fetus to be a human life, I still maintain that the mother's rights override the rights of the fetus. I would be ashamed to live in a country that forced unwilling mothers to incubate babies they didn't want, effectively reducing them to subhumans whose bodies were at the mercy of someone else's whims. This sounds like a nightmare. The government has no right to tell you or any other citizen what medical procedures they  must  undergo or what medical procedures they  may not  undergo.    If a mother chooses not to take care of her child after she gives birth to it, she can be criminally prosecuted for criminal negligence.   The reason the mother is and should be culpable is that, at that point, the child  can  depend on someone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  able  to someone who will care for the child. Before the fetus is viable, it  cannot  depend on anyone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  unable  to find anyone else who will finish the pregnancy for her. Abortion is currently the only option for women who do not want to remain pregnant; if there were some way to remove the fetus and put it in the body of a willing surrogate, I would be all for this.     And if she chooses to give the child away for abortion, then the child will still need the help of another foster mother for survival.   Since this is nonsense, I am going to assume you mean 'adoption' instead of 'abortion'. This does not change a single thing about my argument; at this point, the child can depend on someone but its biological mother for survival, so abortion is not necessary if the biological mother no longer wants to care for it.  --  In addition to my previous point, I would like to pose a hypothetical situation. Someone has a child. When their child is 10 years old, he becomes gravely ill. Only an organ transplant will save him. Unfortunately, the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents. For whatever reason, the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs. Should the government get involved and  force  one of the parents to give the child an organ, under threat of punishment? If yes, why draw the line at a parent-child situation? Why not force every citizen to have their unnecessary organs surgically removed and given to people on the donor list? If no, why not? After all, the humanhood and citizenship of people on the organ list is not even under debate, and you have shown you think it is okay to force people to conserve life/a living human at the expense of their own bodies.",c-kill,0,ab379arg10
ab379,"How can the body of a woman be infringed upon when a woman knows the result of sexual intercourse is a fetus?   When she is prevented from dealing with her body as she sees fit, her rights to her own body are being infringed upon. This is self-evident and if you disagree you are going to have to explain yourself.    You are failing to understand that a parasite can only be from the animal kingdom and not the human kingdom because the fetus itself is from the family of homo sapiens. A parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury. There is no proof of that in a fetus. For a parasitic relationship, those elements of science have to exist.   There is no such thing as a 'human kingdom'. Humans are as much a part of the animal kingdom as cats, chimps, and mice.   Do not assume I don't understand what you are trying to say. It just irrelevant. Regardless of species, the fetus leeches nutrients from the mother and does not return them. Again, this is a parasitic relationship: one organism leeches from another without returning anything. Some definitions include the stipulation of separate species, and others do not. But either way, you cannot possibly argue that the fetus has anything to contribute to the biological relationship. It only takes, it does not return. The claim that pregnancy causes no injury to the woman leads me to believe you have never even spoken to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy is  extremely  taxing on the mother's body, even in environments where she has no shortage of food and does not need to be active. It often leads to malnutrition, anemia, or high blood pressure, and even when it doesn't do any of these things, it is still exhausting, painful, and their bodies will never be the same. This is technically injury to the woman, even though in some cases it may be minor, and is completely natural. If a woman were to be forced to endure a pregnancy based on what someone else think she should do with her body, I am sure the mental toll would also be enormous.

ab389,"her decision but then you want to blame the man for the risk SHE TOOK   I can assure the only person who looks silly here is you. A man is HALF the responsibility of a  pregnancy . It's not my fault that a man has no say in abortion maybe if you actually read what I type you would of seen me say that it's probably unfair that a man by law is denied a say. However in a lot of circumstances the woman consults with the man and they come to a mutual agreement on whether to continue the pregnancy or not.   Who is the one that gets pregnant? Can the man get pregnant? Who takes the risk? Either you are so young that you don't know better....or I just don't know, your ignorant about what responsiblity is   A woman gets pregnant a man gets her pregnant they BOTH take the risk. They are both equally responsible for a  pregnancy . I know far better than you I've had a pregnancy, I have a daughter, I have one of the greatest responsibilities an individual faces because I am a parent. Don't patronize me.   It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man.   It's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.   catticus....is there something wrong with abortion or not? You personally believe...but you still condone....yes, but no....but maybe..   You don't have to be completely decided on an argument since day one of this debate I stated it's neither right nor wrong it's based on  circumstance  and how the woman  feels . I don't condemn anyone who has abortion.   You gave devormity and imperfection as a valid reason for aborting. You personally wouldnt abort on these grounds.........well my dear what grounds would you kill?   I wouldn't have an abortion personally. Just because I think other people have the right doesn't mean I'd do it myself. The only reason I'd kill another person is to defend myself or my child.   I bring up Hitler because Margaret Sanger...influenced him and she was the founder of Planned Parenthood. Your views on this mirror theirs...because they acted them out. Do some research and you will see. Google...Sanger and Hitler...then see if you agree with them. If you don't I would like to know what you disagree with them on   Are you fucking kidding me? Here is one of Margaret's views  advocate abortions on Afro-Americans in order to eliminate what she called ""socially undesirable people""  so I'm a racist now? And there is a massive difference here for a start. I don't believe anyone should be  forced  to have an abortion it's their  choice .   And another  She called for the halt to the medical care being given to slum mothers, and decried the expense to the taxpayers of monies being spent on the deaf, blind and dependent. She condemned foreign missionaries for reducing the infant mortality rates in developing countries, and declared charity to be more evil than for the assistance it provided to the poor and needy. Sanger's thinking moved to fascism in an elitist attitude that presumes to judge who is worthy to live and to die.   I don't agree with ANYTHING this woman promoted or believed. She didn't believe woman had the right to  choose  abortion she wanted to  force  them without a choice. She is racist scum and I have no common ground with any of these views. This is the most disgusting thing anyone has ever accused me of. How dare you?   You call me a pig and then tell me I am mean for comparing your views to Hitler? Come on.......   I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   Do you also support the women who are afraid and kill their born children...Do you also defend people who murder, rape, steal?........hell......you make excuses for everything. You are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn.   No I don't, they're not even the same thing. They're not the same circumstance. I don't make excuses I share my beliefs and opinions and they vary on all of these subjects. How is not condemning something making excuses. Not everyone has to agree with you, it's not the final word or the truth it's an  opinion .   You think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks, it was the wrong sex .....but its ok, if its deformed.   Hold up! I didn't say it was wrong I said it was a little selfish. I never said she couldn't.   You said you would not deny a woman the right to kill, therefore you are pro-abortion, because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed. You are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car...and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing.   You are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she  should  have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.   What does pain have to do with anything? The point I was trying to make was...that you are probably pro-abortion UNTIL.......the time you think the fetus can feel pain. And geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we? I mean that would be inhumane right? You are a joke.   Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.   You say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason...(the man is not an issue unless money is involved)    Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.   after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable.   What? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that  is  the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you. Which is where I get my opinion on when I  think  abortion is okay.   it is unfortunate that you and others do not put any worth in the womb   If I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?",p-right,1,ab389arg0

You think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks, it was the wrong sex .....but its ok, if its deformed.   Hold up! I didn't say it was wrong I said it was a little selfish. I never said she couldn't.   You said you would not deny a woman the right to kill, therefore you are pro-abortion, because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed. You are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car...and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing.   You are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she  should  have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.   What does pain have to do with anything? The point I was trying to make was...that you are probably pro-abortion UNTIL.......the time you think the fetus can feel pain. And geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we? I mean that would be inhumane right? You are a joke.   Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion.

You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.   You say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason...(the man is not an issue unless money is involved)    Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.   after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable.   What? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that  is  the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you.

You personally wouldnt abort on these grounds.........well my dear what grounds would you kill?   I wouldn't have an abortion personally. Just because I think other people have the right doesn't mean I'd do it myself. The only reason I'd kill another person is to defend myself or my child.

She condemned foreign missionaries for reducing the infant mortality rates in developing countries, and declared charity to be more evil than for the assistance it provided to the poor and needy. Sanger's thinking moved to fascism in an elitist attitude that presumes to judge who is worthy to live and to die.   I don't agree with ANYTHING this woman promoted or believed.

It's not my fault that a man has no say in abortion maybe if you actually read what I type you would of seen me say that it's probably unfair that a man by law is denied a say. However in a lot of circumstances the woman consults with the man and they come to a mutual agreement on whether to continue the pregnancy or not.   Who is the one that gets pregnant? Can the man get pregnant? Who takes the risk? Either you are so young that you don't know better....or I just don't know, your ignorant about what responsiblity is   A woman gets pregnant a man gets her pregnant they BOTH take the risk. They are both equally responsible for a  pregnancy . I know far better than you I've had a pregnancy, I have a daughter, I have one of the greatest responsibilities an individual faces because I am a parent. Don't patronize me.   It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man.   It's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.   catticus....is there something wrong with abortion or not? You personally believe...but you still condone....yes, but no....but maybe..   You don't have to be completely decided on an argument since day one of this debate I stated it's neither right nor wrong it's based on  circumstance  and how the woman  feels . I don't condemn anyone who has abortion.   You gave devormity and imperfection as a valid reason for aborting. You personally wouldnt abort on these grounds.........well my dear what grounds would you kill?   I wouldn't have an abortion personally. Just because I think other people have the right doesn't mean I'd do it myself. The only reason I'd kill another person is to defend myself or my child.   I bring up Hitler because Margaret Sanger...influenced him and she was the founder of Planned Parenthood. Your views on this mirror theirs...because they acted them out. Do some research and you will see. Google...Sanger and Hitler...then see if you agree with them. If you don't I would like to know what you disagree with them on   Are you fucking kidding me? Here is one of Margaret's views  advocate abortions on Afro-Americans in order to eliminate what she called ""socially undesirable people""  so I'm a racist now? And there is a massive difference here for a start. I don't believe anyone should be  forced  to have an abortion it's their  choice .   And another  She called for the halt to the medical care being given to slum mothers, and decried the expense to the taxpayers of monies being spent on the deaf, blind and dependent. She condemned foreign missionaries for reducing the infant mortality rates in developing countries, and declared charity to be more evil than for the assistance it provided to the poor and needy. Sanger's thinking moved to fascism in an elitist attitude that presumes to judge who is worthy to live and to die.   I don't agree with ANYTHING this woman promoted or believed. She didn't believe woman had the right to  choose  abortion she wanted to  force  them without a choice. She is racist scum and I have no common ground with any of these views. This is the most disgusting thing anyone has ever accused me of. How dare you?   You call me a pig and then tell me I am mean for comparing your views to Hitler? Come on.......   I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   Do you also support the women who are afraid and kill their born children...Do you also defend people who murder, rape, steal?........hell......you make excuses for everything. You are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn.   No I don't, they're not even the same thing. They're not the same circumstance. I don't make excuses I share my beliefs and opinions and they vary on all of these subjects. How is not condemning something making excuses. Not everyone has to agree with you, it's not the final word or the truth it's an  opinion .   You think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks, it was the wrong sex .....but its ok, if its deformed.   Hold up! I didn't say it was wrong I said it was a little selfish. I never said she couldn't.   You said you would not deny a woman the right to kill, therefore you are pro-abortion, because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed. You are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car...and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing.   You are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she  should  have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.   What does pain have to do with anything? The point I was trying to make was...that you are probably pro-abortion UNTIL.......the time you think the fetus can feel pain. And geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we? I mean that would be inhumane right? You are a joke.   Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.   You say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason...(the man is not an issue unless money is involved)    Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.   after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable.   What? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that  is  the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you.

She condemned foreign missionaries for reducing the infant mortality rates in developing countries, and declared charity to be more evil than for the assistance it provided to the poor and needy. Sanger's thinking moved to fascism in an elitist attitude that presumes to judge who is worthy to live and to die.   I don't agree with ANYTHING this woman promoted or believed. She didn't believe woman had the right to  choose  abortion she wanted to  force  them without a choice. She is racist scum and I have no common ground with any of these views. This is the most disgusting thing anyone has ever accused me of. How dare you?   You call me a pig and then tell me I am mean for comparing your views to Hitler? Come on.......   I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   Do you also support the women who are afraid and kill their born children...Do you also defend people who murder, rape, steal?........hell......you make excuses for everything. You are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn.   No I don't, they're not even the same thing. They're not the same circumstance. I don't make excuses I share my beliefs and opinions and they vary on all of these subjects. How is not condemning something making excuses. Not everyone has to agree with you, it's not the final word or the truth it's an  opinion .   You think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks, it was the wrong sex .....but its ok, if its deformed.   Hold up! I didn't say it was wrong I said it was a little selfish. I never said she couldn't.   You said you would not deny a woman the right to kill, therefore you are pro-abortion, because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed. You are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car...and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing.   You are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she  should  have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.   What does pain have to do with anything? The point I was trying to make was...that you are probably pro-abortion UNTIL.......the time you think the fetus can feel pain. And geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we? I mean that would be inhumane right? You are a joke.   Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.   You say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason...(the man is not an issue unless money is involved)    Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.   after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable.   What? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that  is  the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you. Which is where I get my opinion on when I  think  abortion is okay.   it is unfortunate that you and others do not put any worth in the womb   If I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?",c-sex,0,ab389arg12

It's not my fault that a man has no say in abortion maybe if you actually read what I type you would of seen me say that it's probably unfair that a man by law is denied a say. However in a lot of circumstances the woman consults with the man and they come to a mutual agreement on whether to continue the pregnancy or not.   Who is the one that gets pregnant? Can the man get pregnant? Who takes the risk? Either you are so young that you don't know better....or I just don't know, your ignorant about what responsiblity is   A woman gets pregnant a man gets her pregnant they BOTH take the risk. They are both equally responsible for a  pregnancy . I know far better than you I've had a pregnancy, I have a daughter, I have one of the greatest responsibilities an individual faces because I am a parent. Don't patronize me.   It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man.   It's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.   catticus....is there something wrong with abortion or not? You personally believe...but you still condone....yes, but no....but maybe..   You don't have to be completely decided on an argument since day one of this debate I stated it's neither right nor wrong it's based on  circumstance  and how the woman  feels . I don't condemn anyone who has abortion.   You gave devormity and imperfection as a valid reason for aborting. You personally wouldnt abort on these grounds.........well my dear what grounds would you kill?   I wouldn't have an abortion personally. Just because I think other people have the right doesn't mean I'd do it myself. The only reason I'd kill another person is to defend myself or my child.   I bring up Hitler because Margaret Sanger...influenced him and she was the founder of Planned Parenthood. Your views on this mirror theirs...because they acted them out. Do some research and you will see. Google...Sanger and Hitler...then see if you agree with them. If you don't I would like to know what you disagree with them on   Are you fucking kidding me?

ab394,"What could we show that you would find acceptable as the picture of abortion.   Pretending pro-life people care about scientific fact is bullshit. Not that it's impossible to be scientifically honest and still be pro-life, but so many outspoken pro-life people and groups who have no problem using misinformation, emotional blackmail, intimidation and deceit to manipulate people into doing what pro-life thinks is right. Pro-choice people don't have to lie, because they don't care if no one chooses an abortion as long as they aren't being lied to or bullied. In fact, I think you'd find most pro-choice people would agree that the fewer people need/want abortions, the better. But being dishonest or cruel is not the way to go about making that happen.   Why are D&E;illustrations so commonly used for pro-life propaganda when D&E;accounts for less than 5% of all procedures? Not because it's an honest representation of what most abortions look like, because it isn't. It's because it's supposed to be scarier and more guilt-inducing. If you show this picture to an average woman who is considering an abortion and tell her this is what her procedure will look like, you are probably lying to her.   (I'm not the one putting the semicolon after D&E;, the website is doing that.)   You want abortion legalâ¦on demand period.   You got it.    The fact is abortion is the act of KILLING A LIVING HUMAN BEING. THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT. The heart starts beating around 22 daysâ¦..THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT.   Please show me where I denied that a fetus is a human. Oh wait, I didn't, because I'm not an idiot. Of course a fetus is a human- did you expect me to claim it's a different species? The argument for abortion is sometimes concerned with  personhood , not the presence of homo sapien DNA and you're getting the two confused. But I think abortion would still be acceptable even if the government extended legal personhood to fetuses. One human should not use another human as a life support system unless the host is giving ongoing consent. This applies regardless of the age or legal status of either party or the relationship between the parties. If it's in your body and you don't want it there, you have a right to try to find someone who will take it out.   But tell meâ¦.what would you call killing a living human being without its permission.   Abortion if it's a fetus, murder if it's not. It's cool how there's two different names for that, isn't it? That's so we don't get them confused.    It does not matter what the procedure isâ¦it outcome is the same thing. Death to the unborn.   Oh shit, really?! Well then call me pro-life! Or don't, because I already knew that. Maybe say some more obvious things.    Those who are pro-abortion of course would not like this pic   I'm fine with it. It's not pretty but it's a fairly realistic representation of an uncommon medical procedure. Medical procedures generally are not pretty. It's the use of it to scare women who won't even be getting this procedure that I have a problem with.   Most doctors try to save lives. And abortionists kill lives.   More obvious things!

In fact, I think you'd find most pro-choice people would agree that the fewer people need/want abortions, the better. But being dishonest or cruel is not the way to go about making that happen.   Why are D&E;illustrations so commonly used for pro-life propaganda when D&E;accounts for less than 5% of all procedures? Not because it's an honest representation of what most abortions look like, because it isn't. It's because it's supposed to be scarier and more guilt-inducing. If you show this picture to an average woman who is considering an abortion and tell her this is what her procedure will look like, you are probably lying to her.   (I'm not the one putting the semicolon after D&E;, the website is doing that.)   You want abortion legalâ¦on demand period.   You got it.    The fact is abortion is the act of KILLING A LIVING HUMAN BEING. THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT. The heart starts beating around 22 daysâ¦..THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT.   Please show me where I denied that a fetus is a human. Oh wait, I didn't, because I'm not an idiot. Of course a fetus is a human- did you expect me to claim it's a different species? The argument for abortion is sometimes concerned with  personhood , not the presence of homo sapien DNA and you're getting the two confused. But I think abortion would still be acceptable even if the government extended legal personhood to fetuses. One human should not use another human as a life support system unless the host is giving ongoing consent. This applies regardless of the age or legal status of either party or the relationship between the parties. If it's in your body and you don't want it there, you have a right to try to find someone who will take it out.   But tell meâ¦.what would you call killing a living human being without its permission.   Abortion if it's a fetus, murder if it's not. It's cool how there's two different names for that, isn't it? That's so we don't get them confused.    It does not matter what the procedure isâ¦it outcome is the same thing. Death to the unborn.   Oh shit, really?! Well then call me pro-life! Or don't, because I already knew that. Maybe say some more obvious things.    Those who are pro-abortion of course would not like this pic   I'm fine with it. It's not pretty but it's a fairly realistic representation of an uncommon medical procedure. Medical procedures generally are not pretty. It's the use of it to scare women who won't even be getting this procedure that I have a problem with.   Most doctors try to save lives. And abortionists kill lives.   More obvious things!

By letting political groups take over this very important right of a woman over her own body, you are overstepping your boundaries and effectively hijacking her reproductive organs for your own moral agenda.  Maybe you would have empathy for women on this topic if political activists were campaigning to take control of your ejaculations, arguing that a single sperm is a life, and unless each and every sperm is conserved for female impregnation, you were committing murder.",c-bad_4_mom,0,ab405arg13
ab405,"""Abortion truly is one of the great travesties of modern times. Millions of murders have been committed by misguided women who have been convinced that ending the life of their innocent child is alright.""   Murder is an act which is committed upon persons. A fetus is not a person. Have you ever accidentally cut off a sliver of your skin? You've just killed more cells in that act than the typical abortion.    How can you live with yourself murdering so many cells throughout your lifetime?    ""Life is an ever-progressing journey. It has a beginning and an end. We as humans are constantly changing. I, at the age of 20, am not the same person I was 2 years ago. When I am 40 I will not be the same person. We are constantly growing from the moment of conception until the moment we breathe our last breath.""   However, you are self aware of this journey. A fetus isn't even aware that it is alive. It is a mass of cells with minimal brain tissue if any exists at all.   ""To cut life off at any moment in this contingency that we call ""life"" is murder. We know that human life technically begins at conception. That's all that needs to be said.""   For black and white thinkers such as yourself, that's all that you can understand. You lack a deep understanding of what life exactly is.  Life for us legally begins at birth. Practically speaking it begins when we are first self-aware, which is well beyond the mere fetus stage.  Taking your argument to extremes, every skin cell is a potential life, ready for propagation through activation of totipotentcy and cloning, or enucleation of a host zygote, insertion of your purified DNA and implantation into a host uterus.

Those details i mentioned to you have been proved scientifically and if the courts have determined it as being a human life then how can you call it a parasite? So what if an organism takes and does not returns? Does it means that it is always a parasite? Again one of the laws of parasitism that the source has to be an outside source but in this case the fetus is from the body of the mother itsel. You seem to be confusing the terms parasitic with fetal. Because the relationship between a mother and a fetus can be described as being parasitic does it mean it is a parasitic relationship because what you are looking at is the deinition of the term itself and not the deeper contexts or elements involved in this relationship.   Abortion is still considered murder but is not being practised in society becuase of the ruling which was made in as much as the death penalty is part of the laws of New York but is not being practised.

ab417,"1. The defining characteristic of a person is sapience. You need thought. You need self awareness. And to get those things you need a functioning brain.

Look at the poor people you would have exterminated in order to save them from a life you find pathetic. There are many poor people who are happy.    What about the victims of rape? Should young girls risk their own lives for something they did not even consent to?    What makes you think that you have the right to decide for another human being whether he lives or dies?    Death penalty gives us the right to decide whether someone dies or lives. At war, soldiers constantly decide whether innocent enemy soldiers and civilians should live or die.

ab438,"No, I see abortion as acceptable up until a certain point and evil after another point. You forgot to listen to me again. The gray area is that the overall event of abortion can be good or evil, either black or white, therefore it in itself is gray if you look at it in it's entirety.  Cultures that think it is acceptable to invariably harm the existence of an innocent human being are either going to collapse because they're psychopathic, or they're going to collapse because they are overall brainwashed into not believing that the act of rape doesn't invariably harm a human being. Stop acting like there are tons of cultures that think murder and torture and rape are right, because there aren't. Cannibalism isn't common because only psychopaths and stone age cultures commonly practice it. The same goes for rape and murder. You think murder is acceptable in a place like China or Kuwait because they have different cultures then us? It isn't. Because culture does not bypass morality. The human mind does.  Evil, in a way, is in the eye of the beholder. But harm is not. If you negatively effect the existence of a human being, you are harming it. Whether you think you are harming them or not does not change the fact that you harm them. The ability to attempt perceive this is programmed into our brains through morality. What you need to understand is that harm is infallible. It doesn't matter if Hitler's Nazis thought they were murdering evil Jewish people, because they were, in truth, harming the existence of the human race by deriving it of millions of people. Just because a group of Christians beat a person with turrets to death because they think he's possessed doesn't mean they didn't harm the existence of that human being, disabled or not. Harm is not subjective. It is a state of existence beyond the ability to perceive.   It's radical to say something is totally wrong when many things are not totally wrong depending on the circumstance.  Stop calling you names? No. You look foolish for obviously being close-minded and not even being able to understand anything I'm saying.   My example is NOT sick, you are just a neophyte with no imagination! You think it's wrong, no matter the circumstance, for a perfectly sane and conscious adult to have sex with a perfectly sane, conscious, AND consenting teenager? I said teenager, not child, and there's a difference. Does your morality really only go so far as the law does? What's the difference between a consenting adult and 17 year old having sex and a consenting adult and an 18 year old having sex? The difference is that the law says one is abhorrently wrong... which is, in fact, bullshit. Having sex with someone extremely young is wrong because the child is not consenting and/or under agreement and/or understanding the circumstance in the first place. A teenager at a certain age has the capacity for all of the same things an adult has, including love, judgment, knowledge, awareness, coordination, everything. And if the teenager is a little young and  doesn't  have have all these things, they have almost all of these things. Who are you to dictate that love is wrong based on law or order? Consenting, mutual love is beautiful and chaotic and knows no boundaries. Which brings me to a question for you... if a 90 year old and 60 year old fall in love, is that wrong? There's a 30 year difference, as where a 14 year old and 18 year old have only a 4 year difference. It's illegal for that 18 and 14 year old to fall in love and exercise their love, so why shouldn't the love between a 90 and 60 year old be illegal to exercise physically? Do you not see the whole in that logic? A consenting, understanding person is a consenting, understanding person regardless of age. Children are never consenting and understanding people in regards with sex. Some underage teenagers, on the other hand,  are , by mathematical probability. Mutual, understanding, consenting love shouldn't be restricted by the law, and if you have any compassion, you'll have an imagination and agree with me.  Facts I know about abortion? Facts about abortion are that the fetus does not have brain waves, and therefore a consciousness, until a certain stage in the pregnancy. That's a fact. Duh. I've said that about a dozen times to you. It's funny how you've showed your obliviousness to everything I've been saying by asking for the facts I've been repeating to you over and over again.  Yes, the fact is that a fetus, after a certain point, is a human being. It has a consciousness. Before that certain point, it has no consciousness. Now, I'm going to ask this next question with my caps lock and italics on:  WHAT IS YOUR PROOF THAT A FETUS IS A HUMAN BEING BEFORE IT HAS A CONSCIOUSNESS?  I agree that a fetus with a consciousness is a human being. You think that it's always a human being, period. Give me proof that it is a human being, period, regardless of having a consciousness or not.  I'm not 'pro-abortion'. I have said this multiple times and my ideas are not 'pro-abortion'. Stop saying that I'm 'pro-abortion' before I decide to call you a dumb twat, you oblivious nincompoop.   Yup, I'm God. Everything is God. You're God to, you know.  No, it is a fact that under certain circumstances, sex with a teenager does not harm the teenager or adult, therefore it is not wrong. If it doesn't harm them, how is it wrong?  Cheating can be wrong because it harms the emotions of your spouse or mate, depending on their mentality. Some people don't mind open relationships because they aren't emotionally damaged by cheating. Therefore, for them, cheating is not wrong.  The same applies to lying and stealing. Example for lying: You're a Jew living in Germany. It's 1938. You look a little more German then Jewish. Nazis ask you if you and your family are Jewish. You lie and say you're not Jewish. You save your family and yourself. If you think that lie was wrong, you are a naive, brainwashed fool. Have an imagination that factors in circumstance.  Example of stealing: you're poor and starving. So is your family. A rich man leaves his car unlocked. His wallet with 1000 dollars is in the unlocked car. You steal the money and leave the wallet. You stop your family and you from starving to death long enough to get a job. If you think stealing in that case was wrong, then you apparently are so brainwashed as to not believe in the morality of  Robin Hood .  Child abuse is never wrong, because it's abuse. Abuse is to harm someone for no reason. Harm is infallible. Child abuse is never right.  I do not defend evil. I defend only good. You are just a humongous idiot. In fact, YOU defend evil if you think that the Jew in 1938 shouldn't have lied, if you think the stealing man shouldn't have feed his family, and if the 18 year old with a 14 year old lover should go to jail for the rest of your life.   Do you support these things? I hope you say no.  In the case that you say yes, you are an evil piece of shit. You believe in harming people just because the law tells you to harm people. In which case, you deserve the Hell of the black and white Christianity you so believe in.  But, I don't even think YOU are brainwashed enough to say 'yes'. I'm glad you won't.  You failed to understand what I said, AGAIN. Fool. People who are unconscious still have a consciousness. When you sleep, your brain is a billion times more active then when you're awake. The same goes for comas. They have a consciousness, and therefore we KNOW that they have a soul. A fetus, on the other hand, is not 'unconscious' at every stage of the pregnancy. To be unconscious, you must  have a consciousness in the first place . Until a certain point, a fetus has no consciousness, therefore it is not 'unconscious'. It has no soul.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE TO ME THAT IT HAS A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   Of course your baby would do that, it was the size of a melon and had awareness despite being inside you still! It was human! But you know what? It wasn't human the second it's halves came together and fertilized.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THAT IT HAD A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   No. YOU are sad. You are the saddest sad person to ever be sad. You're the coldest thing to ever exist. My mother died in a car accident at the age of 73. We kept her body alive on life support for a week and pulled the plug after coming to terms with the fact that she was dead when her brain died.   You despicable c-... No, I'll stop from saying that insult. But you are despicable. Vegetable people are masses of meat without any consciousness. They are not comatose... they are not UNCONSCIOUS. They have NO CONSCIOUSNESS WHATSOEVER. I feel sad for you, being such a fool as to think that keeping a conscious-less piece of meat alive is right. To classify a conscious-less piece of meat as a human being is correct.  How about we classify severed limbs as people to, then huh? Then people won't ever be allowed to amputate their arms if they have leprosy. Instead they'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being.   I'd say screw you, but you know what... I don't need to. Your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are. A soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness.   PROVE TO ME THAT A SOUL CAN EXIST IN HUMAN FLESH WITHOUT IT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS.   Do it!   Because if you can't, you CANNOT prove me wrong and never will!",p-right,0,ab438arg0

A teenager at a certain age has the capacity for all of the same things an adult has, including love, judgment, knowledge, awareness, coordination, everything. And if the teenager is a little young and  doesn't  have have all these things, they have almost all of these things. Who are you to dictate that love is wrong based on law or order? Consenting, mutual love is beautiful and chaotic and knows no boundaries. Which brings me to a question for you... if a 90 year old and 60 year old fall in love, is that wrong? There's a 30 year difference, as where a 14 year old and 18 year old have only a 4 year difference. It's illegal for that 18 and 14 year old to fall in love and exercise their love, so why shouldn't the love between a 90 and 60 year old be illegal to exercise physically? Do you not see the whole in that logic? A consenting, understanding person is a consenting, understanding person regardless of age. Children are never consenting and understanding people in regards with sex. Some underage teenagers, on the other hand,  are , by mathematical probability. Mutual, understanding, consenting love shouldn't be restricted by the law, and if you have any compassion, you'll have an imagination and agree with me.  Facts I know about abortion? Facts about abortion are that the fetus does not have brain waves, and therefore a consciousness, until a certain stage in the pregnancy. That's a fact. Duh. I've said that about a dozen times to you. It's funny how you've showed your obliviousness to everything I've been saying by asking for the facts I've been repeating to you over and over again.  Yes, the fact is that a fetus, after a certain point, is a human being. It has a consciousness. Before that certain point, it has no consciousness. Now, I'm going to ask this next question with my caps lock and italics on:  WHAT IS YOUR PROOF THAT A FETUS IS A HUMAN BEING BEFORE IT HAS A CONSCIOUSNESS?  I agree that a fetus with a consciousness is a human being. You think that it's always a human being, period. Give me proof that it is a human being, period, regardless of having a consciousness or not.  I'm not 'pro-abortion'. I have said this multiple times and my ideas are not 'pro-abortion'. Stop saying that I'm 'pro-abortion' before I decide to call you a dumb twat, you oblivious nincompoop.   Yup, I'm God. Everything is God. You're God to, you know.  No, it is a fact that under certain circumstances, sex with a teenager does not harm the teenager or adult, therefore it is not wrong. If it doesn't harm them, how is it wrong?  Cheating can be wrong because it harms the emotions of your spouse or mate, depending on their mentality. Some people don't mind open relationships because they aren't emotionally damaged by cheating. Therefore, for them, cheating is not wrong.  The same applies to lying and stealing. Example for lying: You're a Jew living in Germany. It's 1938. You look a little more German then Jewish. Nazis ask you if you and your family are Jewish. You lie and say you're not Jewish. You save your family and yourself. If you think that lie was wrong, you are a naive, brainwashed fool. Have an imagination that factors in circumstance.  Example of stealing: you're poor and starving. So is your family. A rich man leaves his car unlocked. His wallet with 1000 dollars is in the unlocked car. You steal the money and leave the wallet. You stop your family and you from starving to death long enough to get a job. If you think stealing in that case was wrong, then you apparently are so brainwashed as to not believe in the morality of  Robin Hood .  Child abuse is never wrong, because it's abuse. Abuse is to harm someone for no reason. Harm is infallible. Child abuse is never right.  I do not defend evil. I defend only good. You are just a humongous idiot. In fact, YOU defend evil if you think that the Jew in 1938 shouldn't have lied, if you think the stealing man shouldn't have feed his family, and if the 18 year old with a 14 year old lover should go to jail for the rest of your life.   Do you support these things? I hope you say no.  In the case that you say yes, you are an evil piece of shit. You believe in harming people just because the law tells you to harm people. In which case, you deserve the Hell of the black and white Christianity you so believe in.  But, I don't even think YOU are brainwashed enough to say 'yes'. I'm glad you won't.  You failed to understand what I said, AGAIN. Fool. People who are unconscious still have a consciousness. When you sleep, your brain is a billion times more active then when you're awake. The same goes for comas. They have a consciousness, and therefore we KNOW that they have a soul. A fetus, on the other hand, is not 'unconscious' at every stage of the pregnancy. To be unconscious, you must  have a consciousness in the first place . Until a certain point, a fetus has no consciousness, therefore it is not 'unconscious'. It has no soul.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE TO ME THAT IT HAS A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   Of course your baby would do that, it was the size of a melon and had awareness despite being inside you still! It was human! But you know what? It wasn't human the second it's halves came together and fertilized.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THAT IT HAD A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   No. YOU are sad. You are the saddest sad person to ever be sad. You're the coldest thing to ever exist. My mother died in a car accident at the age of 73. We kept her body alive on life support for a week and pulled the plug after coming to terms with the fact that she was dead when her brain died.   You despicable c-... No, I'll stop from saying that insult. But you are despicable. Vegetable people are masses of meat without any consciousness. They are not comatose... they are not UNCONSCIOUS. They have NO CONSCIOUSNESS WHATSOEVER. I feel sad for you, being such a fool as to think that keeping a conscious-less piece of meat alive is right. To classify a conscious-less piece of meat as a human being is correct.  How about we classify severed limbs as people to, then huh? Then people won't ever be allowed to amputate their arms if they have leprosy. Instead they'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being.   I'd say screw you, but you know what... I don't need to. Your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are. A soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness.   PROVE TO ME THAT A SOUL CAN EXIST IN HUMAN FLESH WITHOUT IT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS.   Do it!   Because if you can't, you CANNOT prove me wrong and never will!",p-rape,0,ab438arg1
ab438,"No, I see abortion as acceptable up until a certain point and evil after another point. You forgot to listen to me again. The gray area is that the overall event of abortion can be good or evil, either black or white, therefore it in itself is gray if you look at it in it's entirety.  Cultures that think it is acceptable to invariably harm the existence of an innocent human being are either going to collapse because they're psychopathic, or they're going to collapse because they are overall brainwashed into not believing that the act of rape doesn't invariably harm a human being. Stop acting like there are tons of cultures that think murder and torture and rape are right, because there aren't. Cannibalism isn't common because only psychopaths and stone age cultures commonly practice it. The same goes for rape and murder. You think murder is acceptable in a place like China or Kuwait because they have different cultures then us? It isn't. Because culture does not bypass morality. The human mind does.  Evil, in a way, is in the eye of the beholder. But harm is not. If you negatively effect the existence of a human being, you are harming it. Whether you think you are harming them or not does not change the fact that you harm them. The ability to attempt perceive this is programmed into our brains through morality. What you need to understand is that harm is infallible. It doesn't matter if Hitler's Nazis thought they were murdering evil Jewish people, because they were, in truth, harming the existence of the human race by deriving it of millions of people. Just because a group of Christians beat a person with turrets to death because they think he's possessed doesn't mean they didn't harm the existence of that human being, disabled or not. Harm is not subjective. It is a state of existence beyond the ability to perceive.   It's radical to say something is totally wrong when many things are not totally wrong depending on the circumstance.  Stop calling you names? No. You look foolish for obviously being close-minded and not even being able to understand anything I'm saying.   My example is NOT sick, you are just a neophyte with no imagination! You think it's wrong, no matter the circumstance, for a perfectly sane and conscious adult to have sex with a perfectly sane, conscious, AND consenting teenager? I said teenager, not child, and there's a difference. Does your morality really only go so far as the law does? What's the difference between a consenting adult and 17 year old having sex and a consenting adult and an 18 year old having sex? The difference is that the law says one is abhorrently wrong... which is, in fact, bullshit. Having sex with someone extremely young is wrong because the child is not consenting and/or under agreement and/or understanding the circumstance in the first place.

Do you support these things? I hope you say no.  In the case that you say yes, you are an evil piece of shit. You believe in harming people just because the law tells you to harm people. In which case, you deserve the Hell of the black and white Christianity you so believe in.  But, I don't even think YOU are brainwashed enough to say 'yes'. I'm glad you won't.  You failed to understand what I said, AGAIN. Fool. People who are unconscious still have a consciousness. When you sleep, your brain is a billion times more active then when you're awake. The same goes for comas. They have a consciousness, and therefore we KNOW that they have a soul. A fetus, on the other hand, is not 'unconscious' at every stage of the pregnancy. To be unconscious, you must  have a consciousness in the first place . Until a certain point, a fetus has no consciousness, therefore it is not 'unconscious'. It has no soul.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE TO ME THAT IT HAS A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   Of course your baby would do that, it was the size of a melon and had awareness despite being inside you still!

You are the saddest sad person to ever be sad. You're the coldest thing to ever exist. My mother died in a car accident at the age of 73. We kept her body alive on life support for a week and pulled the plug after coming to terms with the fact that she was dead when her brain died.   You despicable c-... No, I'll stop from saying that insult. But you are despicable. Vegetable people are masses of meat without any consciousness. They are not comatose... they are not UNCONSCIOUS. They have NO CONSCIOUSNESS WHATSOEVER. I feel sad for you, being such a fool as to think that keeping a conscious-less piece of meat alive is right. To classify a conscious-less piece of meat as a human being is correct.  How about we classify severed limbs as people to, then huh? Then people won't ever be allowed to amputate their arms if they have leprosy. Instead they'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being.   I'd say screw you, but you know what... I don't need to. Your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are. A soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness.

ab438,"No, I see abortion as acceptable up until a certain point and evil after another point. You forgot to listen to me again. The gray area is that the overall event of abortion can be good or evil, either black or white, therefore it in itself is gray if you look at it in it's entirety.  Cultures that think it is acceptable to invariably harm the existence of an innocent human being are either going to collapse because they're psychopathic, or they're going to collapse because they are overall brainwashed into not believing that the act of rape doesn't invariably harm a human being. Stop acting like there are tons of cultures that think murder and torture and rape are right, because there aren't. Cannibalism isn't common because only psychopaths and stone age cultures commonly practice it. The same goes for rape and murder. You think murder is acceptable in a place like China or Kuwait because they have different cultures then us? It isn't. Because culture does not bypass morality. The human mind does.  Evil, in a way, is in the eye of the beholder. But harm is not. If you negatively effect the existence of a human being, you are harming it. Whether you think you are harming them or not does not change the fact that you harm them. The ability to attempt perceive this is programmed into our brains through morality. What you need to understand is that harm is infallible. It doesn't matter if Hitler's Nazis thought they were murdering evil Jewish people, because they were, in truth, harming the existence of the human race by deriving it of millions of people. Just because a group of Christians beat a person with turrets to death because they think he's possessed doesn't mean they didn't harm the existence of that human being, disabled or not. Harm is not subjective. It is a state of existence beyond the ability to perceive.   It's radical to say something is totally wrong when many things are not totally wrong depending on the circumstance.  Stop calling you names? No. You look foolish for obviously being close-minded and not even being able to understand anything I'm saying.   My example is NOT sick, you are just a neophyte with no imagination! You think it's wrong, no matter the circumstance, for a perfectly sane and conscious adult to have sex with a perfectly sane, conscious, AND consenting teenager? I said teenager, not child, and there's a difference. Does your morality really only go so far as the law does? What's the difference between a consenting adult and 17 year old having sex and a consenting adult and an 18 year old having sex? The difference is that the law says one is abhorrently wrong... which is, in fact, bullshit. Having sex with someone extremely young is wrong because the child is not consenting and/or under agreement and/or understanding the circumstance in the first place. A teenager at a certain age has the capacity for all of the same things an adult has, including love, judgment, knowledge, awareness, coordination, everything. And if the teenager is a little young and  doesn't  have have all these things, they have almost all of these things. Who are you to dictate that love is wrong based on law or order? Consenting, mutual love is beautiful and chaotic and knows no boundaries. Which brings me to a question for you... if a 90 year old and 60 year old fall in love, is that wrong? There's a 30 year difference, as where a 14 year old and 18 year old have only a 4 year difference. It's illegal for that 18 and 14 year old to fall in love and exercise their love, so why shouldn't the love between a 90 and 60 year old be illegal to exercise physically? Do you not see the whole in that logic? A consenting, understanding person is a consenting, understanding person regardless of age. Children are never consenting and understanding people in regards with sex. Some underage teenagers, on the other hand,  are , by mathematical probability. Mutual, understanding, consenting love shouldn't be restricted by the law, and if you have any compassion, you'll have an imagination and agree with me.  Facts I know about abortion? Facts about abortion are that the fetus does not have brain waves, and therefore a consciousness, until a certain stage in the pregnancy. That's a fact. Duh. I've said that about a dozen times to you. It's funny how you've showed your obliviousness to everything I've been saying by asking for the facts I've been repeating to you over and over again.  Yes, the fact is that a fetus, after a certain point, is a human being. It has a consciousness. Before that certain point, it has no consciousness. Now, I'm going to ask this next question with my caps lock and italics on:  WHAT IS YOUR PROOF THAT A FETUS IS A HUMAN BEING BEFORE IT HAS A CONSCIOUSNESS?  I agree that a fetus with a consciousness is a human being. You think that it's always a human being, period. Give me proof that it is a human being, period, regardless of having a consciousness or not.  I'm not 'pro-abortion'. I have said this multiple times and my ideas are not 'pro-abortion'. Stop saying that I'm 'pro-abortion' before I decide to call you a dumb twat, you oblivious nincompoop.   Yup, I'm God. Everything is God. You're God to, you know.  No, it is a fact that under certain circumstances, sex with a teenager does not harm the teenager or adult, therefore it is not wrong. If it doesn't harm them, how is it wrong?  Cheating can be wrong because it harms the emotions of your spouse or mate, depending on their mentality. Some people don't mind open relationships because they aren't emotionally damaged by cheating. Therefore, for them, cheating is not wrong.  The same applies to lying and stealing. Example for lying: You're a Jew living in Germany. It's 1938. You look a little more German then Jewish. Nazis ask you if you and your family are Jewish. You lie and say you're not Jewish. You save your family and yourself. If you think that lie was wrong, you are a naive, brainwashed fool. Have an imagination that factors in circumstance.  Example of stealing: you're poor and starving. So is your family. A rich man leaves his car unlocked. His wallet with 1000 dollars is in the unlocked car. You steal the money and leave the wallet. You stop your family and you from starving to death long enough to get a job. If you think stealing in that case was wrong, then you apparently are so brainwashed as to not believe in the morality of  Robin Hood .  Child abuse is never wrong, because it's abuse. Abuse is to harm someone for no reason. Harm is infallible. Child abuse is never right.  I do not defend evil. I defend only good. You are just a humongous idiot. In fact, YOU defend evil if you think that the Jew in 1938 shouldn't have lied, if you think the stealing man shouldn't have feed his family, and if the 18 year old with a 14 year old lover should go to jail for the rest of your life.

Whether you think you are harming them or not does not change the fact that you harm them. The ability to attempt perceive this is programmed into our brains through morality. What you need to understand is that harm is infallible. It doesn't matter if Hitler's Nazis thought they were murdering evil Jewish people, because they were, in truth, harming the existence of the human race by deriving it of millions of people. Just because a group of Christians beat a person with turrets to death because they think he's possessed doesn't mean they didn't harm the existence of that human being, disabled or not. Harm is not subjective. It is a state of existence beyond the ability to perceive.   It's radical to say something is totally wrong when many things are not totally wrong depending on the circumstance.  Stop calling you names? No. You look foolish for obviously being close-minded and not even being able to understand anything I'm saying.   My example is NOT sick, you are just a neophyte with no imagination! You think it's wrong, no matter the circumstance, for a perfectly sane and conscious adult to have sex with a perfectly sane, conscious, AND consenting teenager? I said teenager, not child, and there's a difference. Does your morality really only go so far as the law does? What's the difference between a consenting adult and 17 year old having sex and a consenting adult and an 18 year old having sex? The difference is that the law says one is abhorrently wrong... which is, in fact, bullshit. Having sex with someone extremely young is wrong because the child is not consenting and/or under agreement and/or understanding the circumstance in the first place. A teenager at a certain age has the capacity for all of the same things an adult has, including love, judgment, knowledge, awareness, coordination, everything. And if the teenager is a little young and  doesn't  have have all these things, they have almost all of these things. Who are you to dictate that love is wrong based on law or order? Consenting, mutual love is beautiful and chaotic and knows no boundaries. Which brings me to a question for you... if a 90 year old and 60 year old fall in love, is that wrong? There's a 30 year difference, as where a 14 year old and 18 year old have only a 4 year difference. It's illegal for that 18 and 14 year old to fall in love and exercise their love, so why shouldn't the love between a 90 and 60 year old be illegal to exercise physically? Do you not see the whole in that logic? A consenting, understanding person is a consenting, understanding person regardless of age. Children are never consenting and understanding people in regards with sex. Some underage teenagers, on the other hand,  are , by mathematical probability. Mutual, understanding, consenting love shouldn't be restricted by the law, and if you have any compassion, you'll have an imagination and agree with me.  Facts I know about abortion? Facts about abortion are that the fetus does not have brain waves, and therefore a consciousness, until a certain stage in the pregnancy. That's a fact. Duh. I've said that about a dozen times to you. It's funny how you've showed your obliviousness to everything I've been saying by asking for the facts I've been repeating to you over and over again.  Yes, the fact is that a fetus, after a certain point, is a human being. It has a consciousness. Before that certain point, it has no consciousness. Now, I'm going to ask this next question with my caps lock and italics on:  WHAT IS YOUR PROOF THAT A FETUS IS A HUMAN BEING BEFORE IT HAS A CONSCIOUSNESS?  I agree that a fetus with a consciousness is a human being. You think that it's always a human being, period. Give me proof that it is a human being, period, regardless of having a consciousness or not.  I'm not 'pro-abortion'. I have said this multiple times and my ideas are not 'pro-abortion'. Stop saying that I'm 'pro-abortion' before I decide to call you a dumb twat, you oblivious nincompoop.   Yup, I'm God. Everything is God. You're God to, you know.  No, it is a fact that under certain circumstances, sex with a teenager does not harm the teenager or adult, therefore it is not wrong. If it doesn't harm them, how is it wrong?  Cheating can be wrong because it harms the emotions of your spouse or mate, depending on their mentality. Some people don't mind open relationships because they aren't emotionally damaged by cheating. Therefore, for them, cheating is not wrong.  The same applies to lying and stealing. Example for lying: You're a Jew living in Germany. It's 1938. You look a little more German then Jewish. Nazis ask you if you and your family are Jewish. You lie and say you're not Jewish. You save your family and yourself. If you think that lie was wrong, you are a naive, brainwashed fool. Have an imagination that factors in circumstance.  Example of stealing: you're poor and starving. So is your family. A rich man leaves his car unlocked. His wallet with 1000 dollars is in the unlocked car. You steal the money and leave the wallet. You stop your family and you from starving to death long enough to get a job. If you think stealing in that case was wrong, then you apparently are so brainwashed as to not believe in the morality of  Robin Hood .  Child abuse is never wrong, because it's abuse. Abuse is to harm someone for no reason. Harm is infallible. Child abuse is never right.  I do not defend evil. I defend only good. You are just a humongous idiot. In fact, YOU defend evil if you think that the Jew in 1938 shouldn't have lied, if you think the stealing man shouldn't have feed his family, and if the 18 year old with a 14 year old lover should go to jail for the rest of your life.   Do you support these things? I hope you say no.  In the case that you say yes, you are an evil piece of shit. You believe in harming people just because the law tells you to harm people. In which case, you deserve the Hell of the black and white Christianity you so believe in.  But, I don't even think YOU are brainwashed enough to say 'yes'. I'm glad you won't.  You failed to understand what I said, AGAIN. Fool. People who are unconscious still have a consciousness. When you sleep, your brain is a billion times more active then when you're awake. The same goes for comas. They have a consciousness, and therefore we KNOW that they have a soul. A fetus, on the other hand, is not 'unconscious' at every stage of the pregnancy. To be unconscious, you must  have a consciousness in the first place . Until a certain point, a fetus has no consciousness, therefore it is not 'unconscious'. It has no soul.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE TO ME THAT IT HAS A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   Of course your baby would do that, it was the size of a melon and had awareness despite being inside you still! It was human! But you know what? It wasn't human the second it's halves came together and fertilized.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THAT IT HAD A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   No. YOU are sad. You are the saddest sad person to ever be sad. You're the coldest thing to ever exist. My mother died in a car accident at the age of 73. We kept her body alive on life support for a week and pulled the plug after coming to terms with the fact that she was dead when her brain died.   You despicable c-... No, I'll stop from saying that insult. But you are despicable. Vegetable people are masses of meat without any consciousness. They are not comatose... they are not UNCONSCIOUS. They have NO CONSCIOUSNESS WHATSOEVER. I feel sad for you, being such a fool as to think that keeping a conscious-less piece of meat alive is right. To classify a conscious-less piece of meat as a human being is correct.  How about we classify severed limbs as people to, then huh? Then people won't ever be allowed to amputate their arms if they have leprosy. Instead they'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being.   I'd say screw you, but you know what... I don't need to. Your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are. A soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness.   PROVE TO ME THAT A SOUL CAN EXIST IN HUMAN FLESH WITHOUT IT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS.   Do it!   Because if you can't, you CANNOT prove me wrong and never will!",p-other,0,ab438arg8
ab438,"No, I see abortion as acceptable up until a certain point and evil after another point. You forgot to listen to me again. The gray area is that the overall event of abortion can be good or evil, either black or white, therefore it in itself is gray if you look at it in it's entirety.  Cultures that think it is acceptable to invariably harm the existence of an innocent human being are either going to collapse because they're psychopathic, or they're going to collapse because they are overall brainwashed into not believing that the act of rape doesn't invariably harm a human being. Stop acting like there are tons of cultures that think murder and torture and rape are right, because there aren't.

No, it is a fact that under certain circumstances, sex with a teenager does not harm the teenager or adult, therefore it is not wrong. If it doesn't harm them, how is it wrong?  Cheating can be wrong because it harms the emotions of your spouse or mate, depending on their mentality. Some people don't mind open relationships because they aren't emotionally damaged by cheating. Therefore, for them, cheating is not wrong.  The same applies to lying and stealing. Example for lying: You're a Jew living in Germany. It's 1938. You look a little more German then Jewish. Nazis ask you if you and your family are Jewish. You lie and say you're not Jewish. You save your family and yourself. If you think that lie was wrong, you are a naive, brainwashed fool. Have an imagination that factors in circumstance.  Example of stealing: you're poor and starving. So is your family. A rich man leaves his car unlocked. His wallet with 1000 dollars is in the unlocked car. You steal the money and leave the wallet. You stop your family and you from starving to death long enough to get a job. If you think stealing in that case was wrong, then you apparently are so brainwashed as to not believe in the morality of  Robin Hood .  Child abuse is never wrong, because it's abuse. Abuse is to harm someone for no reason. Harm is infallible. Child abuse is never right.  I do not defend evil. I defend only good. You are just a humongous idiot. In fact, YOU defend evil if you think that the Jew in 1938 shouldn't have lied, if you think the stealing man shouldn't have feed his family, and if the 18 year old with a 14 year old lover should go to jail for the rest of your life.   Do you support these things? I hope you say no.  In the case that you say yes, you are an evil piece of shit. You believe in harming people just because the law tells you to harm people. In which case, you deserve the Hell of the black and white Christianity you so believe in.  But, I don't even think YOU are brainwashed enough to say 'yes'. I'm glad you won't.  You failed to understand what I said, AGAIN. Fool. People who are unconscious still have a consciousness. When you sleep, your brain is a billion times more active then when you're awake. The same goes for comas. They have a consciousness, and therefore we KNOW that they have a soul. A fetus, on the other hand, is not 'unconscious' at every stage of the pregnancy. To be unconscious, you must  have a consciousness in the first place . Until a certain point, a fetus has no consciousness, therefore it is not 'unconscious'. It has no soul.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE TO ME THAT IT HAS A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   Of course your baby would do that, it was the size of a melon and had awareness despite being inside you still! It was human! But you know what? It wasn't human the second it's halves came together and fertilized.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THAT IT HAD A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   No. YOU are sad. You are the saddest sad person to ever be sad. You're the coldest thing to ever exist. My mother died in a car accident at the age of 73. We kept her body alive on life support for a week and pulled the plug after coming to terms with the fact that she was dead when her brain died.   You despicable c-... No, I'll stop from saying that insult. But you are despicable. Vegetable people are masses of meat without any consciousness. They are not comatose... they are not UNCONSCIOUS. They have NO CONSCIOUSNESS WHATSOEVER. I feel sad for you, being such a fool as to think that keeping a conscious-less piece of meat alive is right. To classify a conscious-less piece of meat as a human being is correct.  How about we classify severed limbs as people to, then huh? Then people won't ever be allowed to amputate their arms if they have leprosy. Instead they'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being.   I'd say screw you, but you know what... I don't need to. Your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are. A soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness.   PROVE TO ME THAT A SOUL CAN EXIST IN HUMAN FLESH WITHOUT IT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS.   Do it!   Because if you can't, you CANNOT prove me wrong and never will!",c-baby_right,0,ab438arg11
ab438,"No, I see abortion as acceptable up until a certain point and evil after another point. You forgot to listen to me again. The gray area is that the overall event of abortion can be good or evil, either black or white, therefore it in itself is gray if you look at it in it's entirety.  Cultures that think it is acceptable to invariably harm the existence of an innocent human being are either going to collapse because they're psychopathic, or they're going to collapse because they are overall brainwashed into not believing that the act of rape doesn't invariably harm a human being. Stop acting like there are tons of cultures that think murder and torture and rape are right, because there aren't. Cannibalism isn't common because only psychopaths and stone age cultures commonly practice it. The same goes for rape and murder. You think murder is acceptable in a place like China or Kuwait because they have different cultures then us? It isn't. Because culture does not bypass morality. The human mind does.  Evil, in a way, is in the eye of the beholder. But harm is not. If you negatively effect the existence of a human being, you are harming it. Whether you think you are harming them or not does not change the fact that you harm them. The ability to attempt perceive this is programmed into our brains through morality. What you need to understand is that harm is infallible. It doesn't matter if Hitler's Nazis thought they were murdering evil Jewish people, because they were, in truth, harming the existence of the human race by deriving it of millions of people. Just because a group of Christians beat a person with turrets to death because they think he's possessed doesn't mean they didn't harm the existence of that human being, disabled or not. Harm is not subjective. It is a state of existence beyond the ability to perceive.   It's radical to say something is totally wrong when many things are not totally wrong depending on the circumstance.  Stop calling you names? No. You look foolish for obviously being close-minded and not even being able to understand anything I'm saying.   My example is NOT sick, you are just a neophyte with no imagination! You think it's wrong, no matter the circumstance, for a perfectly sane and conscious adult to have sex with a perfectly sane, conscious, AND consenting teenager? I said teenager, not child, and there's a difference. Does your morality really only go so far as the law does? What's the difference between a consenting adult and 17 year old having sex and a consenting adult and an 18 year old having sex? The difference is that the law says one is abhorrently wrong... which is, in fact, bullshit. Having sex with someone extremely young is wrong because the child is not consenting and/or under agreement and/or understanding the circumstance in the first place. A teenager at a certain age has the capacity for all of the same things an adult has, including love, judgment, knowledge, awareness, coordination, everything. And if the teenager is a little young and  doesn't  have have all these things, they have almost all of these things. Who are you to dictate that love is wrong based on law or order? Consenting, mutual love is beautiful and chaotic and knows no boundaries. Which brings me to a question for you... if a 90 year old and 60 year old fall in love, is that wrong? There's a 30 year difference, as where a 14 year old and 18 year old have only a 4 year difference. It's illegal for that 18 and 14 year old to fall in love and exercise their love, so why shouldn't the love between a 90 and 60 year old be illegal to exercise physically? Do you not see the whole in that logic? A consenting, understanding person is a consenting, understanding person regardless of age. Children are never consenting and understanding people in regards with sex. Some underage teenagers, on the other hand,  are , by mathematical probability. Mutual, understanding, consenting love shouldn't be restricted by the law, and if you have any compassion, you'll have an imagination and agree with me.  Facts I know about abortion? Facts about abortion are that the fetus does not have brain waves, and therefore a consciousness, until a certain stage in the pregnancy. That's a fact. Duh. I've said that about a dozen times to you. It's funny how you've showed your obliviousness to everything I've been saying by asking for the facts I've been repeating to you over and over again.  Yes, the fact is that a fetus, after a certain point, is a human being. It has a consciousness. Before that certain point, it has no consciousness. Now, I'm going to ask this next question with my caps lock and italics on:  WHAT IS YOUR PROOF THAT A FETUS IS A HUMAN BEING BEFORE IT HAS A CONSCIOUSNESS?  I agree that a fetus with a consciousness is a human being. You think that it's always a human being, period. Give me proof that it is a human being, period, regardless of having a consciousness or not.  I'm not 'pro-abortion'. I have said this multiple times and my ideas are not 'pro-abortion'.

Instead they'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being.   I'd say screw you, but you know what... I don't need to. Your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are. A soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness.   PROVE TO ME THAT A SOUL CAN EXIST IN HUMAN FLESH WITHOUT IT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS.   Do it!   Because if you can't, you CANNOT prove me wrong and never will!",c-other,0,ab438arg14

ab455,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM   When did I say that wasn't the law. Do you read  anything  I type?    The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ¦.she took the risk.   Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.    The sperm was a gift, he certainly canât ask for it back can he?   What? Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.   I believe personally that the man should be considered....   If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on  all grounds . Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by  law  then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?   Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said itâs unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?  Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings    Didnât you call me a pig? Better reread that section   You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what itâs like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said. I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâs ovensâ¦ pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.   Of course you will retaliateâ¦you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny. Bolongaâ¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ¦.not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ¦â¦â¦   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?   So you donât like how I put thingsâ¦â¦..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.   No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.   I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth   Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to.   BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION   Good.

Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age. Why don't you produce a real argument?   There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.   For the final time read what I say. Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.   I know the information out thereâ¦you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is  my  words. You ask for evidence you get it.   You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????   I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?",p-right,0,ab455arg0

If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what itâs like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said. I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâs ovensâ¦ pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.   Of course you will retaliateâ¦you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny. Bolongaâ¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ¦.not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ¦â¦â¦   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?   So you donât like how I put thingsâ¦â¦..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.   No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.   I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth   Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to.   BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION   Good. If they were married like you stated he wouldn't be paying child support anyway.   Well you are wrong againâ¦.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Elgin_Gill   128 days earlyâ¦ or 21 weeks 5 days early    http://www.jillstanek.com/archives/2007/                                        02/worlds_youngest.htm   Actually she is. Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age. Why don't you produce a real argument?   There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.   For the final time read what I say. Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.   I know the information out thereâ¦you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is  my  words. You ask for evidence you get it.   You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????   I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?",p-rape,0,ab455arg1
ab455,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM   When did I say that wasn't the law. Do you read  anything  I type?    The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ¦.she took the risk.   Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.    The sperm was a gift, he certainly canât ask for it back can he?   What? Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.   I believe personally that the man should be considered....   If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on  all grounds . Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by  law  then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?   Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said itâs unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?  Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings    Didnât you call me a pig? Better reread that section   You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape.

Of course you will retaliateâ¦you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny. Bolongaâ¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ¦.not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ¦â¦â¦   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?   So you donât like how I put thingsâ¦â¦..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.   No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.   I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth   Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to.   BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION   Good. If they were married like you stated he wouldn't be paying child support anyway.   Well you are wrong againâ¦.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Elgin_Gill   128 days earlyâ¦ or 21 weeks 5 days early    http://www.jillstanek.com/archives/2007/                                        02/worlds_youngest.htm   Actually she is. Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age. Why don't you produce a real argument?   There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.   For the final time read what I say. Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.   I know the information out thereâ¦you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is  my  words. You ask for evidence you get it.   You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????   I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?",p-mother_danger,0,ab455arg3
ab455,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM   When did I say that wasn't the law. Do you read  anything  I type?    The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ¦.she took the risk.   Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.    The sperm was a gift, he certainly canât ask for it back can he?   What? Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.   I believe personally that the man should be considered....   If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on  all grounds . Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by  law  then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?   Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said itâs unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?  Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings    Didnât you call me a pig? Better reread that section   You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what itâs like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said. I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâs ovensâ¦ pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.

Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is  my  words. You ask for evidence you get it.   You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????   I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp.

ab455,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM   When did I say that wasn't the law. Do you read  anything  I type?    The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ¦.she took the risk.   Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.    The sperm was a gift, he certainly canât ask for it back can he?   What? Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.   I believe personally that the man should be considered....   If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on  all grounds . Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by  law  then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?   Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said itâs unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?  Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings    Didnât you call me a pig? Better reread that section   You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what itâs like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said. I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâs ovensâ¦ pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.   Of course you will retaliateâ¦you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny. Bolongaâ¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ¦.not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ¦â¦â¦   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?   So you donât like how I put thingsâ¦â¦..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.   No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.   I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth   Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to.   BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION   Good. If they were married like you stated he wouldn't be paying child support anyway.   Well you are wrong againâ¦.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Elgin_Gill   128 days earlyâ¦ or 21 weeks 5 days early    http://www.jillstanek.com/archives/2007/                                        02/worlds_youngest.htm   Actually she is. Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age. Why don't you produce a real argument?   There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.   For the final time read what I say. Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.

Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what itâs like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said. I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâs ovensâ¦ pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.   Of course you will retaliateâ¦you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny. Bolongaâ¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ¦.not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ¦â¦â¦   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?   So you donât like how I put thingsâ¦â¦..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.   No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.   I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth   Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to.   BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION   Good. If they were married like you stated he wouldn't be paying child support anyway.   Well you are wrong againâ¦.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Elgin_Gill   128 days earlyâ¦ or 21 weeks 5 days early    http://www.jillstanek.com/archives/2007/                                        02/worlds_youngest.htm   Actually she is. Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age. Why don't you produce a real argument?   There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.   For the final time read what I say. Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.   I know the information out thereâ¦you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is  my  words. You ask for evidence you get it.   You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????   I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?",p-other,0,ab455arg8
ab455,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM   When did I say that wasn't the law. Do you read  anything  I type?    The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ¦.she took the risk.   Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.    The sperm was a gift, he certainly canât ask for it back can he?   What? Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.   I believe personally that the man should be considered....   If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on  all grounds . Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by  law  then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?   Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said itâs unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?

I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâs ovensâ¦ pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.   Of course you will retaliateâ¦you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny. Bolongaâ¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ¦.not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ¦â¦â¦   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?   So you donât like how I put thingsâ¦â¦..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.   No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.   I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth   Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to.   BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION   Good. If they were married like you stated he wouldn't be paying child support anyway.   Well you are wrong againâ¦.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Elgin_Gill   128 days earlyâ¦ or 21 weeks 5 days early    http://www.jillstanek.com/archives/2007/                                        02/worlds_youngest.htm   Actually she is. Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age. Why don't you produce a real argument?   There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.   For the final time read what I say. Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.   I know the information out thereâ¦you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is  my  words. You ask for evidence you get it.   You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????   I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?",c-kill,0,ab455arg10
ab455,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM   When did I say that wasn't the law. Do you read  anything  I type?    The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ¦.she took the risk.   Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.    The sperm was a gift, he certainly canât ask for it back can he?   What? Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.   I believe personally that the man should be considered....   If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on  all grounds . Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by  law  then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?   Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said itâs unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?  Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings    Didnât you call me a pig? Better reread that section   You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what itâs like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said.

So you donât like how I put thingsâ¦â¦..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.   No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.   I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth   Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to.   BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION   Good.

Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age. Why don't you produce a real argument?   There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.   For the final time read what I say. Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.   I know the information out thereâ¦you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is  my  words. You ask for evidence you get it.   You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????   I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp.

ab455,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM   When did I say that wasn't the law. Do you read  anything  I type?    The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ¦.she took the risk.   Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.    The sperm was a gift, he certainly canât ask for it back can he?   What? Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.   I believe personally that the man should be considered....   If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on  all grounds . Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by  law  then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?   Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said itâs unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?  Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings    Didnât you call me a pig? Better reread that section   You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what itâs like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said. I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâs ovensâ¦ pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.   Of course you will retaliateâ¦you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny. Bolongaâ¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ¦.not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ¦â¦â¦   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion.

Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned.

Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it.

Also, those back alley doctors will no longer have restrictions placed upon them. They will be able to terminate a pregnancy well after consciousness has begun and the fetus is now a baby. Even when abortion is legal, this kind of stuff happens too much, and imagine how much worse it would be if abortion by qualified doctors was illegal.",c-bad_4_mom,0,ab60arg13
ab60,"""Once the a egg is fertilized and starts to grow into a human body it has a human ""spirit"" or ""soul"" inside of it (for those who are religious).  So if you were to ""dispose"" of this body that IS alive and has a human ""soul"" within it isn't it the same as murder?""   Is this a quantifiable statement. Are we capable of saying that 2 minutes after conception, that bundle of 8 or so cells is not just a human being, but has an intangible ""soul"". And those toe nails i just clipped that are made up of millions of cells, or if a hair gets plucked along with the root that still has a lot more than 8 cells, those have souls too? At what point is the now separate entity no longer ""you""?  If one wears protections, is that not killing potential for having something with a ""soul""? Or is the woman's period also murder because it also is killing the potential for a new human being?   ""So lets put a full grown man/women inside a glass incubator filled with water and have them semi-conscious.  And then lets put a drug in there to kill this person. Then, put a giant vacuum tube into the container and suck all there body parts out.  Is this murder?  Some people will say ""Oh well, that isn't the same. That person is fully developed and eduacated""  There is no difference between killing the grown body and that of a one inside a mother.""   I really don't understand how it's possible to say that a human being, having been alive, having consciousness, can be compared (even in a drugged stupor) to a collection of relatively inanimate bunches of cells. I agree that at a certain point, when the fetus has begun to kick and to show brain activity, that it is now murder to have an abortion. But up until that point, I believe the mother has a right to terminate the pregnancy.  Additionally, you are forming your opinion based on an assumption that all accidental pregnancies happen through laziness. But what if the child has some terrible genetic disease that will render their life to be agonizing. I remember someone referenced a disease on CD where the baby lives for about an hour after birth in terrible pain. Wouldn't it then be mercy then to prevent this from happening before the bunch of cells has become conscious? Or if the woman was a victim of rape or incest, and she got pregnant. I doubt that she would love this child if she carried it to term, and so the child would probably be emotionally malnourished the rest of its life. Would you want to sentence someone to that kind of life?  Another way of looking at is, okay the courts and legislature have agreed to your point of view. Abortions are now illegal. However, that does not mean that people wanting abortions aren't going to happen, and it also doesn't mean that people will stop getting abortions. Women who don't want to or can't carry a child to term will be forced to go to back alley doctors to perform the abortion (or perhaps worse, try to do it themselves) and those unqualified doctors' abortions could lead to their own death in addition to the fetus'. Also, those back alley doctors will no longer have restrictions placed upon them. They will be able to terminate a pregnancy well after consciousness has begun and the fetus is now a baby.

ab68,"""I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being.""  So a thirteen year old girl gets raped, and you're saying that the govenrment have the right to force that girl to keep her unwanted baby? I would imagine the girl would never really bond with her baby, and the child would have to grow up knowing of its conception and live with the knowledge that it was not wanted. Surely that is justification enough? That is not a life anyone would want, and surely aborting that baby in its early stages of development would be the better thing to do.  Also, think of the number of children that would end up in care if abortion was banned. There are enough of them already, the banning of abortion would most definately increase this number, and the more children in care, the lower the quality would become. Where would they get the money to look after so many children? Our taxes? It would get rediculous, and there would be a lot of children out there wishing they had never been born.  I do realise that there are problems with abortion, for example, the amount of people who have unsafe sex because they know they can either take the morning after pill or have an abortion is rediculous. But, I'd like to know that if the contraception i was using didn't work and I fell pregnant through no fault of my own, I would be very happy that I have the option to have an abortion.   Also, when do you begin to class a fetus as a human? I personally would not think of it as a human untill about 12 weeks.

If contraception can't garrentee that i won't get pregnant, I definately want the choice to have an abortion if i needed one.

ab68,"""I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being.""  So a thirteen year old girl gets raped, and you're saying that the govenrment have the right to force that girl to keep her unwanted baby? I would imagine the girl would never really bond with her baby, and the child would have to grow up knowing of its conception and live with the knowledge that it was not wanted. Surely that is justification enough? That is not a life anyone would want, and surely aborting that baby in its early stages of development would be the better thing to do.  Also, think of the number of children that would end up in care if abortion was banned. There are enough of them already, the banning of abortion would most definately increase this number, and the more children in care, the lower the quality would become. Where would they get the money to look after so many children? Our taxes? It would get rediculous, and there would be a lot of children out there wishing they had never been born.  I do realise that there are problems with abortion, for example, the amount of people who have unsafe sex because they know they can either take the morning after pill or have an abortion is rediculous. But, I'd like to know that if the contraception i was using didn't work and I fell pregnant through no fault of my own, I would be very happy that I have the option to have an abortion.

ab85,"Abortion became legal in America in the 1800s and was banned -became illegal - when Americans got their consciences back through a spiritual revival across the nation.   What's funny is that the number of abortions performed were higher when abortion was illegal than when it was legal, and since Roe vs Wade, abortions have continually decreased, especially since the 80s. And, keeping it illegal doesn't stop abortions from happening. It never has. So instead of a legal procedure, being conducted in a safe environment, we're going to end up with a bunch of illegal abortions, in unsafe and unregulated environments.   At the bare minimum abortion is the taking of one person's life.   At the bare minimum, it's the destruction of an accumulation of cells. Depending on the week or trimester, a zygote is not alive--can't even respond to stimuli, and therefore cannot be murdered or killed.   But when you consider that most people have children and their children have children, it opens a whole nother door regarding the massiveness of just one act of abortion.   No, it doesn't. A zygote isn't a ""class of people"", it isn't even a person yet. There are more murders   My position is that abortion is unconscionable and should forever be banned and illegal.   So? Unconscionable doesn't mean it should be made illegal.",p-right,1,ab85arg0

ab88,You mentioned the term parasite so my question to you is does parasites posess the DNA which identifies us each as a human? And if the fetus is indeed a parasite then how come it belongs to the race of homo sapiens referred to as humans? To the extent of my knowledge i was taught that parasites feed from their host in return causing injury to the host which is completely the opposite in terms of the fetus.  A fetus is formed from a sperm cell and a egg cell which identifies it as a developing human with developing organs. If the fetus is indeed a parasite then you are implying that all humans are parasites at the fetal stage and any doctors or scientist will prove you wrong.   The body of a woman is not infringed upon because the fetus is formed from a natural process of reproduction which involves the reproduction of human organisms developing into human beings. Parasites are formed from foreign materials that enter the body but the fetus is formed from the cells of the human body itself which makes it a special function of the sex organs of the human body.  Also you said that people who are caretakers of other people can denounce their rights to take care of that person who is paralyzed but what happens if that person signs a irrevocable power of attorney to stand for the person giving power of attorney. In this case it is a permanent legal contract between the appearer and the person recieving power. And even if this person recuses himself or herself from taking care of the paralyzed person wouldn't that person also depend on the help of doctors to survive? And what about newborns that are one day old? Don't they also feed from the body of the mother? Does that makes them a parasite?,p-right,0,ab88arg0

Parasites are formed from foreign materials that enter the body but the fetus is formed from the cells of the human body itself which makes it a special function of the sex organs of the human body.  Also you said that people who are caretakers of other people can denounce their rights to take care of that person who is paralyzed but what happens if that person signs a irrevocable power of attorney to stand for the person giving power of attorney. In this case it is a permanent legal contract between the appearer and the person recieving power. And even if this person recuses himself or herself from taking care of the paralyzed person wouldn't that person also depend on the help of doctors to survive? And what about newborns that are one day old? Don't they also feed from the body of the mother? Does that makes them a parasite?,c-bad_4_mom,0,ab88arg13
ab88,You mentioned the term parasite so my question to you is does parasites posess the DNA which identifies us each as a human? And if the fetus is indeed a parasite then how come it belongs to the race of homo sapiens referred to as humans? To the extent of my knowledge i was taught that parasites feed from their host in return causing injury to the host which is completely the opposite in terms of the fetus.  A fetus is formed from a sperm cell and a egg cell which identifies it as a developing human with developing organs.
