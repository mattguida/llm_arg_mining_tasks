ma105arg0,"No, I've had first hand experience of what it's like to be around people smoking marijuana. It's a bad pungent odor that can be smelled several yards away. I mean when you can smell someone smoking marijuana from down the street, it's a social issue. In time even the smell gives me a bad headache. Maybe it's in my head, but none of you have the right to put me through that just so that you can say you can get baked legally.  At least cigars and cigarettes odors dissipate fairly quickly, and their odor, while somewhat bad, are not sharp bad pungent odors that carry down the street and waft through people's windows.  Geez, I can't even have my window open sometimes on a warm summer night or a decent time in my backyard on a Friday night because of my next door neighbor who doesn't seem to care that the odor is very strong across the fence in my yard.  It's ridiculous really. Not to mention, with all the problems we have with the mind-altering substance called alcohol, we'd be opening a whole new host of problems if marijuana were legalized, not to mention the public health concern.

We may even find it's not as safe as we thought. And imagine someone who happens to be very allergic to the stuff, you can smell that stuff from several yards away, and in some cases as far as football field or more if the wind is just right.   I have no issues with it being legalized for people to do on their own, away from the public, but that's not what will happen is it. No, what will happen is people will test their boundaries, insist that it can be smoked anywhere regardless of who is affected by it, and that will go on for a while until it's finally brought to court, and years later legislation is finally made that says it can't be smoked in public places or where it causes other discomfort. Then people will fight that saying that there are not harmful side-effects, if in fact we don't discover any, which we won't at first, and they will attempt to smoke it in places where others are affected by it anyway.   And then we've proven how responsible we are with legal mind-altering substances by how we use alcohol.

Not to mention, with all the problems we have with the mind-altering substance called alcohol, we'd be opening a whole new host of problems if marijuana were legalized, not to mention the public health concern.

We may even find it's not as safe as we thought. And imagine someone who happens to be very allergic to the stuff, you can smell that stuff from several yards away, and in some cases as far as football field or more if the wind is just right.   I have no issues with it being legalized for people to do on their own, away from the public, but that's not what will happen is it. No, what will happen is people will test their boundaries, insist that it can be smoked anywhere regardless of who is affected by it, and that will go on for a while until it's finally brought to court, and years later legislation is finally made that says it can't be smoked in public places or where it causes other discomfort. Then people will fight that saying that there are not harmful side-effects, if in fact we don't discover any, which we won't at first, and they will attempt to smoke it in places where others are affected by it anyway.   And then we've proven how responsible we are with legal mind-altering substances by how we use alcohol.

ma129arg0,"The argument you are putting forth goes against the principle that the country's population can be trusted to make their own decisions as long as no-one else is harmed. Marijuana has a track record of being the safest drug around, safer even then alcohol.  Furthermore, the argument that terrorist groups benefit from the marijuana trade is just a myth. Most street-level cannabis dealers would get their product from someone who grows it in the same country - the profit margin of cannabis is small compared to other drugs so importing it is usually not financially worthwhile. Also, you're forgetting that ending the prohibition of marijuana would cut these suppliers out of the system and force them to go legit. Alcohol prohibition in the '30s forced alcohol into the hands of organised crime, and provided them with a source of income as well as putting the general population in danger of an unregulated alcohol market. Once the prohibition was lifted this took away the criminals' largest source of income and allowed the government to control the standards of alcoholic drinks. The same principle applies here - organised criminals would have one less source of income, and the rumoured 'dangerously strong strains of cannabis' could be outlawed so companies growing the plant would only sell it at a sensible and controlled strength.  Also, your argument about cannabis users experimenting with other drugs such as cocaine and heroin: this 'gateway drug' argument is simply unusable in the argument concerning legalisation because legalisation would remove the drug's gateway effects. The idea of cannabis being a gateway drug stems from the idea that, in pursuit of buying cannabis, an individual would associate themselves with the people who sell it: criminals. Drug dealers (like any businessman) naturally want to maximise their profit so they would offer up a stronger drug later on. The lack of distinction between cannabis and stronger drugs (because they're all illegal anyway) would mean the user is more open to trying these drugs. Legalisation would not only remove the criminal market but would also create a visible barrier between what is safe to try and what isn't.  In conclusion, the legalisation of marijuana would be, ultimately, a harm reduction measure. Gangs would lose a source of income and would become less powerful, users would no longer have to associate with criminals, and for once the population of what is meant to be a free country would have the power to make a decision that affects no-one but themselves.

Alcohol prohibition in the '30s forced alcohol into the hands of organised crime, and provided them with a source of income as well as putting the general population in danger of an unregulated alcohol market. Once the prohibition was lifted this took away the criminals' largest source of income and allowed the government to control the standards of alcoholic drinks. The same principle applies here - organised criminals would have one less source of income, and the rumoured 'dangerously strong strains of cannabis' could be outlawed so companies growing the plant would only sell it at a sensible and controlled strength.  Also, your argument about cannabis users experimenting with other drugs such as cocaine and heroin: this 'gateway drug' argument is simply unusable in the argument concerning legalisation because legalisation would remove the drug's gateway effects. The idea of cannabis being a gateway drug stems from the idea that, in pursuit of buying cannabis, an individual would associate themselves with the people who sell it: criminals. Drug dealers (like any businessman) naturally want to maximise their profit so they would offer up a stronger drug later on. The lack of distinction between cannabis and stronger drugs (because they're all illegal anyway) would mean the user is more open to trying these drugs. Legalisation would not only remove the criminal market but would also create a visible barrier between what is safe to try and what isn't.  In conclusion, the legalisation of marijuana would be, ultimately, a harm reduction measure. Gangs would lose a source of income and would become less powerful, users would no longer have to associate with criminals, and for once the population of what is meant to be a free country would have the power to make a decision that affects no-one but themselves.

ma132arg0,"The reason I don't like marijuana, alcohol, hard drugs, and certain kinds of prescription medications is rather simple: I don't think people should sacrifice who they are, in some cases their free will or their humanity.   When someone gives up their free will by becoming a slave to a hard drug or prescription mood and personality altering chemicals it is time for society to step in and give them back control.  Marijuana may be a petty offender, much less of an offender than alcohol, tobacco, meth, cocaine..etc.., but it is still a means of giving up who you are or keeping yourself in a state of non-growth.   We, as human beings, have a duty to ourselves to grow, change, improve, but always in the context of who we are. Drugs are a way to retard this development, deny who we are, and cope with a world that rejects us. It is an escape; an escape which noone deserves.   I don't mind people escaping in other ways: video games, reading, television, camping..etc, at least they are still thinking, at least their self is still intact and operating.   When people do drugs they stop being people and start being Mr. or Ms. X+meth, or X+Marijuana, or X+alcohol. It isn't helpful; it's downright harmful in the long-run.   Governments and societies are meant to protect us; usually from dangers outside. This danger, this threat is unique in its internal, self-inflicted nature.   Again, Marijuana is only a petty offender in this case; which is why I am not adamant about its status as an illegal narcotic. There are far worse legal drugs which I am much more concerned with.   Does that help in explaining my objection to its use? I am still forming my opinion on this one so I know my logic is abit choppy and in some cases exaggerated.",p-not_addictive,0

Illegal marijuana is as inefficient as Prohibition. The difference is that the punishment is worse, and the drug is far less dangerous.   I would argue that marijuana should be illegal as long as all other drugs are illegal, but then again, marijuana has actually treated people with anorexia and helped other people with loss of appetite. What does alcohol do that helps when you ingest it? Nothing. It helps when you swab it on an open wound, but then again, why ingest such a thing? A thing so rancid it kills bacteria automatically?   The answer is that people just do. Prohibition proved that people always will, no matter what any government tries to do. Instead of jailing people, it should be legal, and taxed, and controlled by the government so that it doesn't somehow contribute to killing people.  Then maybe one day, the government will be able to stop tobacco and alcohol companies from killing people to.",c-addiction,0

ma166arg0,"When it comes to my point of view on the legalization of Marijuana I believe that there is no reason what so ever for it to remain illegal.  I'm not going to go into detail explaining what many have already said, about the medical uses, stress relief, etc, but when it comes to the profit that could be made this way, an enormous amount of opportunities open up.  First thing that comes to mind with the legal sale of Marijuana is tax. Why have a tax other then sales tax? Hell, why not? Are you not willing to pay that extra amount to be able to legally smoke? Is that extra tax not worth being able to sit in clear view and toke it up without worrying about going to jail if you're caught? Of course it is!  Realistically, we could add the Cigarette tax from each state onto a package of Joints. 4 average rolled joints at $10 + tax. Sure, you're getting slightly less than a dime's worth, but again, that extra amount is more than worth it.  If marijuana was to be considered for legalization, and lets say they were to use Texas as the Beta-State, a package of 4 joints would cost $11.41 after tax. Lets say Joe goes through the average dime in about 2 days. That's 178 dime bags in a year. As of now that would cost him $1780, and it would cost $2030.98 if it was legalized and taxed. That is $250.98 more than he would normally pay for a slightly less amount of weed. About .1 gram per package to be exact, on average.  That is $250.98 in profit to the government, in 1 year, from 1 man. That means slightly under 4000 people (3985) would allow the government to make a profit of one million dollars.  Did I mention that is in addition to the money saved yearly on arrest and court costs? Imagine this... 6458 (adjusted for the California cigarette tax) people in California smoke marijuana once it has become legalized. That's $1 million in profit, in addition to saving the $100 million that it is estimated to spend yearly on arrest and court costs. I'm failing to see the problem with this idea.  On a large scale, I think I read somewhere about 10% of the American population admitted to smoking marijuana. The last estimated count was about 303.8 million people in the US, so 30.38 million have admitted to regular use. The average tax on cigarettes around the US is about $.53 per pack, at even just 1 dime per week, equals to an average profit of $837.27 million dollars annually.  This estimate does not include the millions of Americans who did not admit to their regular use, nor to the hundreds of millions that would be saved on arrest and court costs.  In addition, think of all the new job openings of adding several large scale marijuana plantations. Hundreds of job possibilities open up, allowing the percentage of jobless adults to decrease. Hell, make a few new college courses about Marijuana History, Growing Marijuana, the Cultivation of Marijuana. Easily opening up new job opportunities for people to strive for. Sure, it's not the perfect job, but if you can convince people to go to school for it, and make a college degree required to work on the plantation, I bet it would convince hundreds of students to return to school with their career choice in mind.  All of these are just estimates and I have no way of knowing any exacts. But as my estimates are reasonable, and pretty close to being exact with the information I've researched, even if it didn't provide an adequate source to replace paper products, or medical uses, or any of the other dozen + things that marijuana is useful for, the profit in taxes and the annual savings in court costs and the job opportunities more than justify the legalization of marijuana.",p-not_addictive,0

That is $250.98 in profit to the government, in 1 year, from 1 man. That means slightly under 4000 people (3985) would allow the government to make a profit of one million dollars.  Did I mention that is in addition to the money saved yearly on arrest and court costs? Imagine this... 6458 (adjusted for the California cigarette tax) people in California smoke marijuana once it has become legalized. That's $1 million in profit, in addition to saving the $100 million that it is estimated to spend yearly on arrest and court costs. I'm failing to see the problem with this idea.  On a large scale, I think I read somewhere about 10% of the American population admitted to smoking marijuana. The last estimated count was about 303.8 million people in the US, so 30.38 million have admitted to regular use. The average tax on cigarettes around the US is about $.53 per pack, at even just 1 dime per week, equals to an average profit of $837.27 million dollars annually.  This estimate does not include the millions of Americans who did not admit to their regular use, nor to the hundreds of millions that would be saved on arrest and court costs.  In addition, think of all the new job openings of adding several large scale marijuana plantations. Hundreds of job possibilities open up, allowing the percentage of jobless adults to decrease. Hell, make a few new college courses about Marijuana History, Growing Marijuana, the Cultivation of Marijuana. Easily opening up new job opportunities for people to strive for. Sure, it's not the perfect job, but if you can convince people to go to school for it, and make a college degree required to work on the plantation, I bet it would convince hundreds of students to return to school with their career choice in mind.  All of these are just estimates and I have no way of knowing any exacts. But as my estimates are reasonable, and pretty close to being exact with the information I've researched, even if it didn't provide an adequate source to replace paper products, or medical uses, or any of the other dozen + things that marijuana is useful for, the profit in taxes and the annual savings in court costs and the job opportunities more than justify the legalization of marijuana.",c-Other,0
ma167arg0,"I support legalizing marijuana, because those countries that have marijuana legal have less problems with schedule 1 drugs. What happens in the US is that those who do smoke marijuana get caught with it and get put on probation. While they are on probation that start using Schedule 1 drugs like Cocaine, which exits your system in no more than 72hrs. This is why marijuana is a gateway drug. For those who do not smoke marijuana, I don't think that making it legal would make much of a difference. Marijuana is like cigarettes being so easy to come by that if you wanted to smoke it you would go get you some.

ma171arg0,"In reality, Marijuana is just as bad as tobacco and alcohol, however, Marijuana is proven to be a gateway drug into crack cocaine, heroin, opium, etc. It is also proven that the typical marijuana user smokes until high, not until relaxed. When a person is high, he or she is not fully functional. Most daily alcohol drinkers do not drink to get drunk, they drink until they're relaxed, that is one reason alcohol is legal. Marijuana is unfiltered and will cause lung damage as well as tobacco, however tobacco does not affect how you function while marijuana does (as previously stated). Marijuana also has proven to take a permanent toll on the adolescent brain. It has proven poorer performance on thinking tasks, slower motor skill speed, poor attention span, poor verbal memory, and planning ability. Even with 3 weeks of abstinence of Marijuana, attention span is permanently affected but motor skills, planning ability, and thinking tasks have slightly increased but are still affected. With Marijuana use, the brain is working harder than it should causing stress, shorter life span, and a weaker body in the long run. Though Marijuana has proven to help slow down medical issues, it still only slows down, does not cure the medical issue. Same goes with prescription medicine. Most of them only slow down your issue, not get rid of it. The reason prescription medicines are legal is because your doctor needs to allow you to take it. I'm fine if you use marijuana because your doctor prescribes it to you, however most of the time, that is not the case and Marijuana is abused by many teens and young adults.

Marijuana is unfiltered and will cause lung damage as well as tobacco, however tobacco does not affect how you function while marijuana does (as previously stated). Marijuana also has proven to take a permanent toll on the adolescent brain. It has proven poorer performance on thinking tasks, slower motor skill speed, poor attention span, poor verbal memory, and planning ability. Even with 3 weeks of abstinence of Marijuana, attention span is permanently affected but motor skills, planning ability, and thinking tasks have slightly increased but are still affected. With Marijuana use, the brain is working harder than it should causing stress, shorter life span, and a weaker body in the long run. Though Marijuana has proven to help slow down medical issues, it still only slows down, does not cure the medical issue. Same goes with prescription medicine. Most of them only slow down your issue, not get rid of it. The reason prescription medicines are legal is because your doctor needs to allow you to take it. I'm fine if you use marijuana because your doctor prescribes it to you, however most of the time, that is not the case and Marijuana is abused by many teens and young adults. There is a reason the future of America (and the world) is going downhill. The increased Marijuana use in high school and middle schoolers is one of the main reasons.",p-legal,0

ma176arg0,"I have to disagree with your comparison of marijuana to alcohol in some respects. Although it is true that being high is kind of similar to being drunk there are some significant differences; marijuana makes things feel, for lack of a better term, sillier. Alcohol on the other hand, when used in excess can lead to blacking out, vomiting and not remembering what happened. In this way alcohol is significantly more dangerous. Whereas you can die from alcohol intoxication, too much marijuana really can't hurt you. Also, most of the negative feelings associated with alcohol, such as guilt and regret, are typically not experienced when using marijuana. We have also seen what happens when you make alcohol illegal: organized crime grew significantly in major cities because they were able to make an absurd amount of money selling bootleg liquor. Comparing alcohol to marijuana in this context would be accurate. The selling of marijuana by gangs is very profitable. You say that we should go down to Mexico to smoke but I live in Delaware and if I want to smoke with my friends going to Mexico for a weekend isn't a viable option. Instead I would have to find a drug dealer. This puts money in the hands of bad people. Legalization would put a stop to this.   Finally, for someone who claims to love the USA so much you seem to be okay with suppressing freedoms. The reason Mexico is different from the US is because they are relatively poor, their government is corrupt, and crime is rampant.

Bad things:  Marijuana is proven to cause depression and change brain patterns in odd ways among other things. But there are many worse drugs.

(Just because you set these rules doesn't mean people will follow them.)  3. Marijuana would not be cheaper than it is today. If the government had control over it they would make the price way higher than it is at street value. And this wouldn't stop drug lords, do they not have cigarettes on the black market at dirt cheap prices? Wouldn't you buy from someone growing themselves at a cheaper price to avoid a tax? How does that stimulate a business let alone the whole economy?  4. The last thing we need is more people doing it.

ma253arg0,"Recent studies that were highlighted in the BBC3 UK documentary ""Should I smoke Pot?"" showed marijuana is actually more dangerous than I previously believed. The really interesting point the documentary highlighted was the risk of psychosis from taking the drug where the THC content was very high. In one session a test subject rated a 14 for psychosis, it was highlighted that a 1 or 2 was normal and above a 4 was generally considered to be in the ballpark of the schizophrenic.  Why am I bringing this up when I'm against criminalising the drug? The answer really lies in how people get hold of marijuana in the first place. People will, no matter what the law tries to enforce, use marijuana for recreational and medicinal purposes. With that said these users have no real access to quality control over their drug. They can get hold of very high THC content skunk which can quickly make them paranoid and prone to all the negative effects of psychosis. Where they may be better choosing a much lower THC variety imported.  If the drug were controlled, distributed legally and taxed. The levels could be monitored, the dealers, many of whom are dealing in harder drugs and offering those up too would be out of business overnight. This would sever the link some users have who are suggestable to moving onto harder drugs. Also de-criminalising the drug will make it easier to treat people who do end up abusing it and need help. If you have a drink problem today, you can turn to friends and family as well as your doctor. If you're a ""druggy"" you're very unlikely to get any help from anyone, making any problem you might develop possibly worse.  With everything legal and marijuana available in cafes (as they are in Amsterdam for instance) the public can be educated on what the real side effects of the drugs are, what the benefits are and have the ability to choose wisely on various strains to find one that suits that person. Just as I might end up finding out I prefer shandy when I go to bars. A mixture of beer and lemonade which makes it less alcoholic.   Finally I think the children would benefit too.

ma276arg0,"The reasons for why pot should be legalized are all legitamite but people are only looking at the big picture. Sure it can benifet society in many ways but their are so many down sides to legalizing pot. If everyone were to become pot attics they would become more and more addicting up to the point that all they want to do is smoke pot.

In my mind, no one else should have any greater authority over your own body, than you. And no one should have the right to tell you, that you can't do something that you want, to yourself. We are adults living in a free country, Why do we not have the right to make such choices? As long as we act responsibly, and don't harm others, what is our crime?  At the very least, We shouldn't be locking people up, for non-violent non-victim ""crimes"".  BTW, I believe decriminalization will not solve the important issues. Only the selfish or the misinformed support decriminalization over legalization. Legalization is the key to regulating it to make it safer, and to taxing it, which could GREATLY improve our economy right now.",c-Other,0

ma331arg0,"if it's legal it means there will be more of it, more people smoking it, and more problems associated with it.

Being illegal has been somewhat of a deterrant but if we take off the deterrant more people will be stoned more often. (take abortion for example).

Crashes under impairment would likely go down, as many bars might adopt marijuana instead of alcohol. Orp people might start smoking instead of drinking. Studies have shown that impairment while driving (while not encouraged ,and should have a limit, like alcohol. Keep in mind we didn't develop one before re-legalizing it in 1937.) Other studies show that cannabis going illegal at the same time alcohol became legal again was a gift to organized crime.  See, organized crime didn't exist the way it did (or at all) before alcohol prohibition. That literally changed the face of our nation.

In the history of mankind, prohibition of any substance that one puts into their own body has never worked.  Alcohol was no more or less popular during prohibition, than now. The only difference was that instead of States and the feds recieving tons of tax dollars, and the money from alcohol purchase going into the hands of legitimate businesses that employed citizens who contributed to society and paid taxes,  all the money was going to gangsters and thugs.  Well, the same thing is going on now. Marijuana was not made illegal until 1937. Before then the plant was taxed. It employed people. Now it is not taxed, and those who sell it are usually criminals of some sort (though many are harmless)  Still, the amount of marijuana consumed has not diminished one bit.  Cannabis has been used all through recorded history.   link    What makes us think that now, in the last 72 years something about the plant has changed.  Marijuana's illegal status is a historical farce. It's laughable, pointless, and counter productive.  1. Marijuana is a better pain killer, with less harmful side effects than any perscription drug. It costs less (0 if you have dirt and water already) and it's less addictive.  Are there harmful side effects of marijuana? Yes, but no more so than any other drug including alcohol, tobacco, or caffiene.   2. Taxes collected from the sale of marijuana would be in the hundreds of millions, it would give our economy an enourmous boost and employ potentially hundreds of thousands of people.  3. It would take the money from illegal drugs  out of  the hands of criminals.  4. It would be a huge relief on our overcrowded prisons, saving States hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, even millions in States with large prison populations like CA. Also, it would save the 18 year old A student and college hopeful from losing all his scholarships and having to check  YES  on every application that asks if they've ever been arrested, for the rest of his or her life, just because they had a tiny amount of a plant that is far safer than alcohol.  and by all means, come visit my blog sometime, www.crazydrugnews.blogspot.com.",p-not_addictive,1

It's only ""contributing to crime"" because it's illegal.   That's not the same logic. Ideally, marijuana use would be legal, driving would be legal, and they would never happen at the same time. But suppose it does, and someone mows down a pedestrian at a crosswalk and gets charged with manslaughter. In that case, marijuana use would be a contributor to the crime, but not illegal in itself, much like alcohol is now.   Legalizing marijuana does not necessitate repealing ""driving under the influence"" laws. Driving while high, would still be illegal, but recreational use in the privacy of one's own home should not be illegal.   I agree. But just like alcohol, people will still use it and drive.

ma396arg0,"Yes. In comparison to those substances which we allow (alcohol and tobacco being the two most obvious) it is really no worse. It is far less potentially addictive than the other two, does not appear to have nearly as many physical ailments associated with it as tobacco or heavy alcohol use, and is much less likely to incite violence than alcohol. Some argue that this marijuana is a gateway drug. They forget that many people who use other drugs also began drinking first. The reason further drug experimentation is more likely to occur with pot use than with alcohol is not because pot ""leads one to search for a better high"" (otherwise we should expect similar results with alcohol, as it is more ""mellow"" than harder drugs) but is almost certainly because one is legal and the other is not. Legalization also increases the amount of information health agencies can get about its use and make it more likely for heavy users to get treatment. And it is simply ludicrous for our already strained prison and court systems to have to process people for possession and distribution of a substance that is roughly equivalent to substances we accept. And arguably the best point: we could stop using taxpayer money to crack down on dealers and instead tax pot sales via liscenced distributors.

Though these are not the bad guys, of course, it's just that marijuana does change you, it does change your body, the way you think, thus the dangerous mark is understandable.   The 'high' effect is an abnormal state that will never fit it with the standards. in fact, it changes people so much they often consider upper spiritual intervention and skip their way to the bible, only to find (or intentionally reinterpret) juicy quotes of Jesus puffing away - THESE are the bad guys.

ma77arg0,"societys prohibition in 1937, extract of Cannabis sativa (marijuana) was one of the top three most prescribed medicines in the US. When it became illegal, its use as a medicine became restricted. Despite these regulations research on the medical use of marijuana continued. I have read this article it's so interesting there are many thing why cannabis shouldn't be legalize  http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/ addiction/issues/marijuana.html     One thing I learned is that marijuana does relieve pain and that it is not nearly as addictive as morphine. It can ease the nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and, at the same time, give you a wonderful high.  Despite the positives, I am not convinced. There are so many other factors that need to be considered. Marijuana causes some parts of the brain - such as those governing the emotions, memory and judgment - to spin out of control.If you choose to ignore the attacks and memory loss, consider what marijuana can do to your lungs. Its smoke carries more tar and other particles than tobacco.
