Saying those words is simply and honestly stating that we are ONE NATION UNDER GOD. In fact, we are not at all. And yes we could just not say it, but speaking from a student's point of view, it makes me very uncomfortable to stay seated because I have no belief in a god.( or just stand and say nothing, etc..)  And, also, it doesn't make it right just because most of the united states is a deity believer. If most americans thought it would be cool to kill a bunch of African Americans.... you can't do it. if a majority wants to violate our religious rights... you cant do it.",

Even though I wasn't around for the Cold War, I understand why under God was added, mostly to say This is America, not the Soviet Union!  We're better because we believe in God!  Similar reasoning applies for making the national motto In God We Trust.  What, exactly, does people trusting in God say about the US as a country?  Looking at it from a secular point of view, I think that's an inferior motto to E Pluribus Unum, which sums up this country perfectly.  Lots of people don't believe in the Judeo-Christian deity, and not just the nonreligious.  Is the government calling all of those people unpatriotic?  The answer is definitely yes.  Here's a simple test:  Try replacing it with under Allah or under Vishnu.  Think that's any different?  It's not.  Same message, just aimed at different groups.  From the Bible Belt, here's a vote to get under God out of the Pledge, and for E Pluribus Unum as the motto.",

If, for example, the U.S is considered a religious country, then if they speak about God, they should consider thinking about what God does for his people, not only what he chooses for being wishy-washy. He can't prohibit something the U.S for being different or because something looks bad or inappropriate as some might say.

The pledge went without conflict until the 1950's, when a Catholic interest group convinced the President to add the words. It was only once the words were added that it became a problem. Then, the recitation of the pledge became wrong for many citizens as it was now more of a prayer, both to a monotheistic God and another idol which is banned in Judaism. Thus, more and more kids are being pressured into saying things that conflict with their religion in school because by not doing so, they are thought to be unpatriotic. This may seem like a pretty stupid analogy, but personally I think it explains the concept very well. This whole debate is like sandwiches and mayonaise. Some people may be allergic to Mayo. Some people may really enjoy aMayo on their sandwich. But the people who like the Mayo are able to eat the sandwitch without, while people who are allergic CAN'T eat the Mayo.

We need to teach them to think for themselves, not through the government. Also, children shouldn't be forced to pledge to a country. Teach the children to analyze their country when they are old enough then let THEM decide if they wish to pledge to their country. I for one am glad I live in America, but I am not proud of my country and don't want to pledge to it, let alone a god that I don't believe in. God may be real to some, but he is not real to me.
