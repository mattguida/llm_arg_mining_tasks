Marriage is a legal matter and gays don't have their legal rights.  if you worry about how gay couples can't have children, guess what, there are many children in foster care and are waiting to get adopted so if gays got married and adopted children it would acually HELP  and why do people care so much about what other people are doing if it doesnt hurt anyone else then WHO CARES",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,0

"Gay vs Straight marriage is primarily a religious issue.  The marjor religious opposition is based on their belief that God prohibits man laying with man (and note nothing said about women with women).  No gay group are attempting to require any religion to marry them, and there is no chance they could succeed because the government can pass no such law.  Religious groups opposing Gay marriage remind me of how some religions opposed black  and white marriage because they felt it is immoral or a a slippery slope.  But religion and state government is by constitutional law prohibited from controlling the agenda of each other.   None of this has anything to do with the original purpose of marriage, namely to provide rights of inheritance.

God didnt say that men and men should get married or women and women. The world is coming to an end and in the bible it is said that the sins of the people will grow and this is happening. We dont want our children growing up and thinking that oh its okay to marry somone of their own sex. Next think you know our children will be getting married with animals. Like me some people dont want gay marriage to be allowed and we want our rights to be respected. Like in the word of God it is said that he created a women so the man wouldnt be alone he never said he created women so the womwn wouldnt be alone.

How can one say that if discrimination is supposedly occurring for homosexual couples regarding marriage, how is it not the case that polygamists, polyamorists are not being discriminated against? If marriage becomes anything that anyone wants because they want validation for their lifestyle, then the definition is meaningless. For those who don't believe in marriage (male and female for example), why not have the federal government grant benefits (taxes, soc. sec, etc.) to common-law sitiuations? How about if 5 women married 3 men...all should get benefits? What if 1 or 2 want to leave the marriage are the others still married, or will it be required that legal documents be redone? Will children of those marriages have 5 Mommies and 3 Daddies? Who gets the child, if there is a divorce and the child was adopted? Why not allow first cousins, brothers and sisters to marry ( if they are sterile) ? Why not? They may love each other and they may not be able to help it. Why not allow an 82 year old man to marry a 14 year old boy (if that's the age of consent)",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,0
Homosexuals can bring children into the world naturally and biologicaly . Conservatives think that a homosexual can't have sex with a woman and that is why homosexuals can't have children.

When a man and a woman have  achild so it does not mean that it has something to do that there's heterosexual . Reproduction has nothing to do with love .

Either way population will grow , and if a child gets raised in a homosexual house hold, who is anyone to say its worse then living in a crack house or an abusive house ?  Gay Marrige is a postitive thing our world could use , gay people can raise a child BETTER then a father-mother household. A normal household parents are abusing their child and on dugs. LOVE IS LOVE why should people have to hide who they are to be normal Nobody is NORMAL if they where the world whouldn't be the shi whole it isand we wouldnt be at war. Why deny someone to have it say on paper their married? Either way gays will be around and will live and be togther as a married couple.",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,0

But really I hope for a day when this whole country wakes the heck up and allows people to marry whoever they love....seriously only 10% of people are gay so it's not like we would loose our population because of it.

If we allow atheist to marry, we must allow gays to marry.  Or will would we be willing to additionally revoke the marriage status of every atheist or atheist couple?",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,0
"I hear a lot of Pro comments that wonder why so many Christians have an opinion.  Well first off, the homosexual movement has tried to take a Christian symbol which is the rainbow which represents God's covenant with His people and make it as their symbol.  And now the homosexual movement wants to have the same respect as heterosexuals by legalizing their marriage and claiming that there is no difference between the two.  Homosexuals have rights and laws protecting them against discrimination.  They have the right to choose who they want to express their sexuality with.  Discrimination is not the issue and whether God is for or against it is not the issue either.  The issue is whether or not homosexuality affects society and whether there should be a law protecting it.  Well first off if everyone was a homosexual no one would be alive.  Secondly, some psychologist say that pedophiles are born pedophiles and that is not accepted nor should it be.

"I see a lot of leaning on Leviticus to condemn homosexuality as morally wrong. This is the same book that states that you cannot wear clothing made from two different threads.

There is no room in there for hatred, if you claim to be a Christian. But, marriage is only for producing children! So, you're saying infertile couples should not be allowed to marry. Or the marriage of married couples who become infertile due to accident or disease is no longer valid. People like my aunt, who had to have her uterus removed so that she wouldn't die.

If we address gay marriage on the basis of religion then yes it is considered wrong. but fact is no two people are going to have the same identical beliefs. some would say there is no  god and others say there is.

Yes we do not have to promote gay marriage  neither support it but I strongly feel that if two people want to marry and are the same sex then it really isn't the same as two of opposite sex. Why? Simple reason marriage combines the forms of male and female not just for bearing children but it's a psychological thing.  A guy needs a girl to support him and understand him and listen to his problem; and a female needs a guy to support her and provide for her in ways she cannot provide for herself.

"One of my objections to same sex marriages is that it may give those people monetary advantages intended for normal married couples.  The prime example is that they would receive a reduction of their Federal, and probably State, income taxes if allowed file jointly.

"The traditional marriage that is held in such high esteem is a relatively recent construct, perhaps 100 years old.  Prior to that, marriages were planned by two families for financial, political and other reasons.  Little input was allowed from the groom-to-be and no input from the bride-to-be.  This type of marriage is still practiced in several parts of the world.  Women were/are seen as chattel, something to be used in bargaining not unlike a prized cow or a fecund mare.  Is this what those against same-sex marriage really want to bring back?  As to the need for both a male and a female, a father and a mother, to breed and rear children:  where do the hundreds of thousands of single-parent families fit?  As with straight parents, same-sex parents are equally concerned for and participate in the lives of their children.  Multiple studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents do as well as those from a straight home; sometimes they do even better.  I have a goodly number of friends in committed relationships (two going back over 40 years) who have children;  these kids are brought up in a warm, supportive, loving home.  Each of these kids (aged 6 months to 42 years) is a wonderful person; the older guys and girls are happy, productive, loving members of society in school and at work.  And, to those who might be so concerned:  of the 34 kids that I know (in same-sex homes), 4 are Gay and 2 are lesbians.  That seems to fit within the accepted percentages.  The argument that Gays are mentally disordered is too specious for words.  In the developed world, there is neither a legitimate Medical nor Psychiatric association that would agree with that claim.  The statement from T. Hansen about [t]he accumulated wisdom of 5000 years is germane to nothing.  The social, legal and/or religious definitions of and practices of marriage have varied widely over time.  Each society, each generation has defined the concept of marriage to fit its own needs.  The slippery slope arguments is one of the oldest chestnuts to cause confusion and install fear and doubt.  The cited outcomes of same-sex marriage border on preposterous and inflammatory.  No reasonable person could possibly follow the inane blathering.

"To say that allowing gay marriage will eventually lead to allowing people to marry animals is ridiculous. For one, people are people, no matter what the sexual preference.

Some say that it's against their religion. Getting mad at someone for going against your religion is like getting upset with someone for eating a donut because you're on a diet.

Another argument would be that children need a mother and father. What about all the single parents that raise their kids?

Gays should be treated equally. I  feel as though if you're against gay marriage you shouldn't marry your heterosexual partner. One reason people may oppose gay marriage is for religious reasons. Because the bible condemns homosexuality as an immoral and unnatural sin. and marriage is a religious thing Even Though homosexuality MIGHT be a sin, it's not greater than any other sin.

Gays should be treated equally. I  feel as though if you're against gay marriage you shouldn't marry your heterosexual partner. One reason people may oppose gay marriage is for religious reasons. Because the bible condemns homosexuality as an immoral and unnatural sin. and marriage is a religious thing Even though homosexuality MIGHT be a sin, it's not greater than any other sin.
