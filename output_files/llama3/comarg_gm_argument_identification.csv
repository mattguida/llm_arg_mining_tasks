One day, I would like to be able to marry my girlfriend. It's my right as a human being to marry whoever I want to as long as there is consent.

"In answer to It is wrong to create fatherless or motherless families by design. Same-sex marriages have more to do with the desires of adults than the needs of children. Human experience and a vast body of social science research show that children do best in married, mother-father households..Bologna!!There is no solid evidence saying that gay couples put children in an unstable environment children need love and acceptance it doesn't matter what your sexual orientation is if you are capable of being responsible and compassionate- there are many good married Christian parents who abuse and shame their children- Children need positive role models not intolerance and a morality that picks and chooses what's right and wrong, and translates the bible to suit their own agenda.As for Ann Landers comment that gay marriage 'flies in the face of cultural and traditional family life as we have known it for centuries. And that's where I must draw the line. Sorry.- Obviously the first few thousand years of existence when people lived without marriage and in poly-amorous extended families, with different spiritual beliefs is not a part of history she cares to learn about Christianity was not the first religion and God is way too big to fit into such a limited un-inclusive belief system",Gay couples should be able to take advantage of the fiscal and legal benefits of marriage,1
"There is a mixed up message in culture today thinking the church is invading in political issues and that it has to do with our constitutional rights. This is the complete reverse of what was written in a letter by Thomas Jefferson when he stated, Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God; that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship; that the legislative powers of the government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should `make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, thus building a wall of separation between church and State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore man to all of his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties. It means the government should not butt in with the business of God and the church. A True Marriage is between God, man, and woman. NOT Ones government or county!",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,1
"'Congress shall make no law... prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech' That's from the Bill of Rights. Same-sex marriage isn't wrong. It's actually sort of genetic. The Bible isn't meant to dictate what laws should be vetoed or voted for. Religion will never fit with Politics. There are just too many religions, and us Athiests are tired of it! We need to stop all our fussing about this so-called 'Bible' and focus on something like our economy!",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,1

Being gay is something you are born with you cant wake up one day and say  im gonna be gay. thats like saying one day your are just gonna be black or white  or asian. Not allowing gays to marry is cruel and unjust they are people just like you and me. they feel the same thing that we feel. allowing the banning of same sex marriage is saying its okay to hate against someone wo is different. america is about accepting people for who they are and allowng them to live freely.  people say it is against God's will. maybe it is but we are not God and souldnt judge. in the bible it says only God can judge others not us. let them live there lives without judgment and them being marked as outsiders.,It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,1

"California voters have twice affirmed the self-evident fact that marriage is only for one man and one woman when they approved Proposition 22 in 2000 and Proposition 8 in 2008. But in the end, the truth isn't based on votes or opinion polls or mere feelings. When it comes to real marriage, human physiology clearly shows that a man and a woman are physically designed to fit together. Science continues to show that there is no gay gene therefore no special rights or laws are justified for those who engage in homosexual behavior. And study after study continues to affirm that the best environment for a child to be raised is with a married father and mother living under the same roof. Government schools and the entertainment media have done a powerful job of teaching moral relativism ad nauseam, while avoiding the teaching of real science and biology on this matter. And with no rigorous critical thinking taught in public schools, it's not surprising that the younger generation is confused about sexual absolutes and numb to societal consequences. The truth has always been, and will always remain, no matter what any law says, that if you don't have one man and one woman, you don't have real marriage.",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,1

I don't see why homosexual couples can't just be happy with the same benefits of marriage but calling it a civil union not marriage.  Marriage is a creation of religion and as such should remain defined as a union between a man and a woman.

Gay Marrige is a postitive thing our world could use , gay people can raise a child BETTER then a father-mother household. A normal household parents are abusing their child and on dugs. LOVE IS LOVE why should people have to hide who they are to be normal Nobody is NORMAL if they where the world whouldn't be the shi whole it isand we wouldnt be at war. Why deny someone to have it say on paper their married? Either way gays will be around and will live and be togther as a married couple.",Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage,1
"I am against gay marriage and I don't care what anyone thinks. They can call me cruel, heartless, and a bigot, but frankly I don't give a damn about that. I am against Gay marriage because I believe that Marriage is a sacred covenant between one man and one woman. I hold to what the bible teaches about this issue. The real thing for me though, is I DON'T WANT MY CHILD TO HAVE TO GROW UP IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY HAVE TO WONDER WHY THEY HAVE A MOM AND DAD AND NOT JUST TWO DADS OR TWO MOMS.",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,1
"I am against gay marriage because I try to do as Jesus Christ taught in John 13; Love one another; as I have loved you.  I believe that the love that Christ taught in this scripture is a love based on wanting the best for an individual.

Homosexual relationships are strictly banned in The Bible in Romans 1:27, as well as in other verses, and I believe that making something that God has spoken against legal would be very disrespectful to Him and His infinite love for us.",Major world religions are against gay marriages,1

"I am opposed to gay marriage because it disrespects and degrades the religious values upon which the United States was formed. The founding fathers were good Christian men who recognized their dependence on God and sought to obey His commandments. John Adams recognized the importance of a moral and virtuous society within the US when he said Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other. To legalize marriage between gay partners is to legitimize the choice to disregard a commandment of God. However, God will not be mocked. If we as a nation continue to publicly legitimize behaviors that are morally illegitimate according to God's laws, we will cease to have His guidance and support in our lives.",Major world religions are against gay marriages,1
I am pro because homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals.  The institution of marriage is not being ruined by homosexuals it is ruined by the fact we can now go to vegas get drunk go through a drive through and be married then sober up in the morning and make it go away.  This is being done too often and that is the downfall of the institution itself not a loving couple no matter if it is a man and man a woman and woman or a man and a woman being married.,It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,1
I believe gay marriage should be legalized because everybody deserves to be happy. Alot of people are seeing it on the perspective of religion not from the perspective of letting two people be happy.

"I believe homosexuality is a perversion of a natural/original creation. The question is why?  I believe  lack of spirituality, hormonal influences and mutations are responsible for the original outcoming. Women no longer can find a good man to take his responsibilities as husband and father, and since women no longer need a man for financial support they are given up on looking for Mr. Right.  Men on the other hand , are more guilty in crime, as they have abandonned their purpose in order to follow lustful ways, just attend a gay pride parade and you know what I 'm talking about. I don't like what is being imposed on us by this gay movement. I believe all sexuality should be discrete, and yet they allow themselves to force their views and way of life trying to make it mainstream.

"I hear a lot of Pro comments that wonder why so many Christians have an opinion.  Well first off, the homosexual movement has tried to take a Christian symbol which is the rainbow which represents God's covenant with His people and make it as their symbol.  And now the homosexual movement wants to have the same respect as heterosexuals by legalizing their marriage and claiming that there is no difference between the two.  Homosexuals have rights and laws protecting them against discrimination.  They have the right to choose who they want to express their sexuality with.  Discrimination is not the issue and whether God is for or against it is not the issue either.  The issue is whether or not homosexuality affects society and whether there should be a law protecting it.  Well first off if everyone was a homosexual no one would be alive.  Secondly, some psychologist say that pedophiles are born pedophiles and that is not accepted nor should it be. The question is not are they born this way, the question is how does this behavior affect society.  Plain and simple, heterosexual marriage is the safest way to engage in sexuality and everything else is risky behavior and there should not be laws protecting it.",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,1

Jeez, that mean-girl clique in high school always said we were going to Hell for wearing poly-blends, but I didn't think they meant it literally.

There is no room in there for hatred, if you claim to be a Christian. But, marriage is only for producing children! So, you're saying infertile couples should not be allowed to marry. Or the marriage of married couples who become infertile due to accident or disease is no longer valid. People like my aunt, who had to have her uterus removed so that she wouldn't die. She's not married to my uncle anymore, is what you're saying.

Yes God exepts all sinners but that does not make murder right. I'm a teenager and I know how wrong it is.

I think that gay marriage should be allowed in every part of the world. If two people love eachother and want to be together forever then that should be it. Let them do it. The saying Love Is Love should be used. In the religious aspect of everything God says in the Bible that you should love everyone and treat them with kindness and compassion. So people who discriminate against the same sex wanting to be together are not Christians or do not believe in God. Places where they have same sex marriage banned are going to have chaos if they dont legalize it soon. I strongly believe that if two people love eachother then let them do what they want. If any oppurtuity comes up where love is shown then it's just making the world a more loving place.,It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,1

Statistics show the divorce rate dropped 21% between the years 2003 and 2008, giving it the lowest divorce rate in the country. No evidence is given to support the fact that the legalization of gay marriage has ever been recorded to have had a negative effect on this aspect of the institution.

"My disagreement lies more with the argument for altering the existing union of male/female marriage, which is based on a falacy that homosexuals are somehow legally restricted in their right to engage in marriage, as defined between man and a woman. In fact, it is their sexual orientation that ultimately prevents their desire to participate in traditional marriage (not some law or form of discrimination toward homosexuals). There are actually many self proclaimed homosexuals who do currently engage in traditional marriage (and raise families, etc.) This is proof that homosexuals are not restricted from marriage (as defined between man and a woman) I truly believe that the powers behind the cause to re-define marriage stem from a stronger desire to attack a religious institution that does not support homosexuality, rather than a desire to achieve the same benefits as marriage for same sex couples.

"One of my objections to same sex marriages is that it may give those people monetary advantages intended for normal married couples.  The prime example is that they would receive a reduction of their Federal, and probably State, income taxes if allowed file jointly.  If you go back and study the Congressional committee reports that established the Federal reduction of taxes for married couples, I believe you will find that it was based on the premise that a wife during her child bearing and rearing years will have reduced ability to contribute to the family income.  This may also apply to other government programs.  Assuming that the average voter would object to the reduction for same sex marriages, this may be an argument to oppose such marriages.

"Perhaps we should look at the state interest in gay marriage. Why would the state want to marry two homosexuals? How does it serve the state? It doesn't, therefore it does not serve state interest. Now perhaps we should look at the public health catastrophe among gay men. Or perhaps the psychological problems involved with children being raised under a homosexual marriage. There are many problems with homosexuality outside of religion. Think about the bigger picture. Instead of thinking about the effects of the straight community on homosexuals, think about how homosexuals may be effecting the straight community. Homosexuals ask for fairness and to not be messed with by the straights. The straights ask for the same thing: not to be messed with by the homosexuals.

So please, with all due respect...see the future before you make any progress now..before it's too late.",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,1
Those who are gay deserve all the rights of those who are straight. No person should ever be told that they can't be with the person they love because of something they can't change.  We are all equals. To take away a person's rights is unfair and wrong.,It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,1
"To say that allowing gay marriage will eventually lead to allowing people to marry animals is ridiculous. For one, people are people, no matter what the sexual preference. And animals wouldn't even be able to sign marriage papers! Many say that it is unnatural. So are the clothes you wear, and most of the things you use in every day life. Some say that it's against their religion. Getting mad at someone for going against your religion is like getting upset with someone for eating a donut because you're on a diet. The Bible bans shaving, gossip, football, mixing fabrics, eating pork and lobster, and so many other things. You can't just pick and choose what to follow. Another argument would be that children need a mother and father. What about all the single parents that raise their kids? Yes, only a man and woman can reproduce, but some marriages that isn't an option. Should we ban infertile and elderly marriages too? And allowing gay marriage won't turn anyone gay just like being around tall people doesn't make you grow. The bottom line is that everyone deserves to be treated equal and fair. Gay marriage will not harm anyone, and there isn't ONE valid argument against it.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,1

"Unless... two gay people can create a life, which is why we are here as two opposing sexes. According to the gays, there should be one sex here on the earth. OR .. better yet.. what if the world consisted on only gay people?  There would be no children. Is that normal? Is this what God intended?   It is not natural and normal to bbe gay. It is a handicap.It is a chemical imballance. OR.. a choice. A handicap is a defect that can't be helped.However.. no one says this. That leads me to believe it is a choice then. Children need both opposing sexes. Unless.. the gays plan to re write the child care books on children's natural development.  Children are a sponge. Children will pick up on the abnormality of having two of the same sex parents which is not normal.

"marriage is a religious construct mandated by God.  Civil unions offer the same benefits as marriage.  The Bible is very clear that homosexuals, adulterers, idol worshipers (money and power in today's terms) the will drunkards, the sexually immoral, and the lascivious will not inherit the company of heaven.  When one repents and changes their ways God is unable to see their former sin through the veil of Jesus's sacrifice and blood.  It should be noted that contrite repentance is required and as well as an attempt at stopping the sin.  God does not dilineate which sin is worse, they are all equal.  God mandates marriage between a man and woman, no where is same sex marriage addressed.  It seems that the gay lobby wants merely to attack Christian and Jewish beliefs and destroy the constructs of what God mandates marriage to be.  Civil unions are the legal answer, and since most gays do not believe in the true sacrifice of Jesus and that we have a responsibility to live Godly live as free from sin as possible, even fleeing from sin as the Bible says.

"marriage is a religious construct mandated by God.  Civil unions offer the same benefits as marriage.  The Bible is very clear that homosexuals, adulterers, idol worshipers (money and power in today's terms) the will drunkards, the sexually immoral, and the lascivious will not inherit the company of heaven.  When one repents and changes their ways God is unable to see their former sin through the veil of Jesus's sacrifice and blood.  It should be noted that contrite repentance is required and as well as an attempt at stopping the sin.  God does not dilineate which sin is worse, they are all equal.  God mandates marriage between a man and woman, no where is same sex marriage addressed.  It seems that the gay lobby wants merely to attack Christian and Jewish beliefs and destroy the constructs of what God mandates marriage to be.  Civil unions are the legal answer, and since most gays do not believe in the true sacrifice of Jesus and that we have a responsibility to live Godly live as free from sin as possible, even fleeing from sin as the Bible says.

"no, because what is the benefit? You can not have children.. you can adopt but the natural producing of the offspring can not be performed. You may make people more happy.. well, thats a mental stat for that person. not everyone in the world will be happy (that's your own personal state that doesn't affect everyone. Also, It is not natural.. God made for oppisite genders not two of the same........ Also, you can't have natural pleasure of sex and creating life with people the same gender. being gay isn't genetic either.. You are born into your environmment.. YOU choose based on what you want..",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,1
