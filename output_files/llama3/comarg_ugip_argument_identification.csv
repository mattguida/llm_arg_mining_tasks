"As an devout atheist I strongly oppose this. It seems like some people don't understand that there IS  a seperation between church and state. Now I have to join the herd and recite a few words that mean nothing to me? We have something called a church that people do this in. So why is it in a public school?  Are we forgetting about those who may practice hinduism, buddhism, shintoism and other religions? What about them?  I don't care if the majority of people are Christains. SO! But since when do the majority decide what is best for everyone? Where are we in China now?  By the way, I thought as a good bunch of christains you were not suppose to mention thy lord's name in vain. CLAP CLAP Good for you.....NOT!

"Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise. - James Madison   Genius that statement was written in refrence to a tyrant that would have forced you to say under God on pain of DEATH! And the simple yet increadibly important thing that all you Cons seem to be forgetting is that NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO SAY OR BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU DONT WANT TO!!!! Since it was added 58 Years ago no one has been forced to believe in God, or put to death for not believing in the Almighty, nor has anyone been incarcerated for not saying those words in the pledge so quit all your meaningless bitching about how your looking for attention and want everyone to look at you, cause we both know thats what all of this is really and truely about. When we get down to the core you all just want to have everyones attention while you create problems for 89% of the country!

"I've noticed some pro-people saying, We can't force our religion on others, but atheists can force theirs on us?nTechnically speaking, Atheism isn't a religion, just the lack of one.

"No, they should be officially removed. The idea of having a religion test in the Pledge of Allegiance is repugnant to me. I learned to say the Pledge before those words were added, and I refuse to utter them today, as I believe their presence violates good sense and the Constitution. They were added in the mid-Fifties in a rather successful attempt to mobilize American opinion against those godless communists. In other words, they were war-talk.

"I am against having the statement Under God in the pledge for two reasons. It is violating the first amendment and the separation of state and church, and it is also offensive to the atheists and the people of other religions. You that you don't have to say it if you don't want to. I am an atheist and I prefer not to say it. For a long time after they take it out (if they do, of course), people will accidentally say it from habit of it being in there so long when it didn't need to. You CAN still be Christian even if the pledge to your country doesn't say Under God.",Separation of state and religion,1

"Atheism doesn't mean the absence of religion - it means the absence of a god in one's belief system.  Certain forms of Buddhism, for example are atheistic.  Therefore, requiring a statement of belief in a god is unconstitutionally preferring a majority religious belief over a minority one.

"I chose the con side based on my interpretation of the first amendments freedom of religion which states Congress may make no law respecting an establishment of religion. This means two things, the first being that the government shall not interfere with the church. But how can we do that if one religious interpretation is in the government? If we have a Christian based government, as the pledge implies, how can we be sure that the government will be fair to all beliefs? The best way is to keep church out of state.

If they are not born in American, they shouldn't have any rights to change what our Four Father's start in American.  Since we took God out of school, our school is over run with children who doesn't listen or mind.  And people wonder why there is so many children shooting other children and adults.

As is evident, the nation was based on ideals of religious freedom, and if somebody wishes to remain a patriot, pledging allegiance to their country, they should not be coerced to state something they don't believe to be true. Although a democratic government is based on majorities in the long run, in this case we very well may be violating the rights guaranteed to citizens via the Bill of Rights. The founding fathers, when constructing the constitution may have included references to their own religion, in this case Catholicism, but as we see a certain diversity being created in this past century, it is important to note that we as a nation should be more open to accept these different ideas to better suit all citizens. nnThat said, maybe it would have been easier to go along with the pledge that was first introduced which would have allowed for every citizen to feel their place in the country.",Removing under god would promote religious tolerance,1

A simple lesson in history confirms that the Jews believed in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; the Christian religion came out of the Jewish faith and added the teachings, life, and purpose of Jesus Christ but also held to the God of Abraham, and the Muslim, who calls him Allah, also believes in the God of Abraham.

"No, the words under God should not be included in the US Pledge of Allegiance because they are completely unnecessary and cause far too much contreversy for what they are worth. The pledge went without conflict until the 1950's, when a Catholic interest group convinced the President to add the words. It was only once the words were added that it became a problem. Then, the recitation of the pledge became wrong for many citizens as it was now more of a prayer, both to a monotheistic God and another idol which is banned in Judaism. Thus, more and more kids are being pressured into saying things that conflict with their religion in school because by not doing so, they are thought to be unpatriotic. This may seem like a pretty stupid analogy, but personally I think it explains the concept very well. This whole debate is like sandwiches and mayonaise. Some people may be allergic to Mayo. Some people may really enjoy aMayo on their sandwich. But the people who like the Mayo are able to eat the sandwitch without, while people who are allergic CAN'T eat the Mayo.
