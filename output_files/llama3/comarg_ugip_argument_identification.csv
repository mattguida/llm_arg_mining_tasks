"As an devout atheist I strongly oppose this. It seems like some people don't understand that there IS  a seperation between church and state. Now I have to join the herd and recite a few words that mean nothing to me? We have something called a church that people do this in. So why is it in a public school?  Are we forgetting about those who may practice hinduism, buddhism, shintoism and other religions? What about them?  I don't care if the majority of people are Christains. SO! But since when do the majority decide what is best for everyone? Where are we in China now?  By the way, I thought as a good bunch of christains you were not suppose to mention thy lord's name in vain. CLAP CLAP Good for you.....NOT!

As is evident, the nation was based on ideals of religious freedom, and if somebody wishes to remain a patriot, pledging allegiance to their country, they should not be coerced to state something they don't believe to be true. Although a democratic government is based on majorities in the long run, in this case we very well may be violating the rights guaranteed to citizens via the Bill of Rights. The founding fathers, when constructing the constitution may have included references to their own religion, in this case Catholicism, but as we see a certain diversity being created in this past century, it is important to note that we as a nation should be more open to accept these different ideas to better suit all citizens. nnThat said, maybe it would have been easier to go along with the pledge that was first introduced which would have allowed for every citizen to feel their place in the country.",Separation of state and religion,1

At the same time however, how in our day and age, with such a diverse group of subcultures within our great country, can we allow something that blatantly disregards all other deities believed in by other Americans? Yes, the majority of Americans may believe in Catholicism and thus not have a problem with the phrase, but being selfless for a second, instead of self-centered, taking those two words out makes a bit of a difference to those who do not believe in that specific deity or any at all. And if we're being honest, why does it matter so much to keep it in?      Some might think, I want it in because I am a devout Christian (or whatever) and I want to represent that in my daily life. But, you know what, that's what churches and other places of worship are for.      Last time I checked, being proud to be an American meant being proud to embrace everything America is built on, namely diversity.

"The words Under God should not be removed from the pledge of allegiance. This country was founded by men and women who wanted to be able to worship God freely.  It was a Christian country, even though the 1st amendment states freedom of religion. And it still does. The country can be religious without persecuting those who do not believe the same, and that's exactly how it is. No one is punished for believing whatever they want, they are free to worship when, how, where, and who they want. but they should NOT have the freedom to change our country's background. Our currency has 'in God we trust' on it, our forefathers were christian men who feared God. That is how our country rose to be the greatest, most powerful country in the world. Now that our country is starting to turn its back on God, look what has happened. Crime, divorce, drug, and suicide rates have all risen. Not to mention the country has been surpassed by many countries, is in trillions of dollars of debt, and is pretty much owned by China.

As well, the US Constitution states that our Country and Government are to be separate from any and all religions. Therefor, the current existence of the phrase Under God is something that is closer being against our nation's ideals than keeping it, it's just never been changed because a lot of people don't understand why some people want it removed. Also, it's not 'Our' flag, it's the flag of any and all American citizens, not just the ones who happen to believe in the existence of your God or any God for that matter.

"No, the words under God should not be included in the US Pledge of Allegiance because they are completely unnecessary and cause far too much contreversy for what they are worth. The pledge went without conflict until the 1950's, when a Catholic interest group convinced the President to add the words. It was only once the words were added that it became a problem. Then, the recitation of the pledge became wrong for many citizens as it was now more of a prayer, both to a monotheistic God and another idol which is banned in Judaism. Thus, more and more kids are being pressured into saying things that conflict with their religion in school because by not doing so, they are thought to be unpatriotic. This may seem like a pretty stupid analogy, but personally I think it explains the concept very well. This whole debate is like sandwiches and mayonaise. Some people may be allergic to Mayo. Some people may really enjoy aMayo on their sandwich. But the people who like the Mayo are able to eat the sandwitch without, while people who are allergic CAN'T eat the Mayo.
