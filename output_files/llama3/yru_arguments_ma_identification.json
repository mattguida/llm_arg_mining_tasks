That is not at all my logic. if it was, I would have said that we should keep marijuana illegal because people get it illegally. Rather what I am saying is that it is only common sense that it can be a contributor to crime.   Marijuana does not hurt anybody   It most certainly does. There have been many deaths directly linked to marijuana use. Car crashes are a common way in which people under the influence of marijuana harm themselves, and others.",

      "comment": "Marijuana should be legalized BECAUSE it is dangerous.   If 'dangerous' is the over-all term for anything that might shunt one from his formal, initial, eligible state of his body. An imaginary state of fully-functioning, flawless, ideal body. Structured by psychology, biology, culture and all kinds of institutions, to distinguish sanity from lunacy, health from illness, intelligence from ignorance. Though these are not the bad guys, of course, it's just that marijuana does change you, it does change your body, the way you think, thus the dangerous mark is understandable.   The 'high' effect is an abnormal state that will never fit it with the standards. in fact, it changes people so much they often consider upper spiritual intervention and skip their way to the bible, only to find (or intentionally reinterpret) juicy quotes of Jesus puffing away - THESE are the bad guys. These people underestimate the abyss between themselves and the machine that produced the metaphors they use to explain their experience.   The data field of it's effects is radically shaped by the method of learning it, thus a non-user and a do-user are both biased, the argument between the two always hides the law underneath it, which separates them even more. The point is that some day the do-user won't have the need of such self-deceit, just like most of us manage to live without defying the meaning of life.  Stigma dissolving is not necessary, maybe not even possible, the stigma is not a merit of either side of the coin, it is the coin itself, the need to justify and 'OK' stamping one's inevitable position on either side demands the improvisation of rational evidence of truth.   Once a full legalization is executed, there might be a radical separation and a birth-approval for new culture, new moral, new rationalism that neutralizes the holiness around such a nihilistic notion of 'reasonable behavior', new thought, new language, new engagement with whatever is or is not considered reality. While the non-user will embrace the whole coin to morph it into a monopoly of the whole opinion spectrum within the data field of marijuana study, and will create yet another standard, unifying abstainers as much as absence of activity can be conceivable as a common denominator.   'Users' will consider the activity as we all consider sugar, it just won't be considered at all.",

According to a federal Institute of Medicine study in 1999, fewer than 10 percent of those who try marijuana ever meet the clinical criteria for dependence, while 32% of tobacco users and 15% of alcohol users do. So if you got  \"addicted\" to marijuana, it's because you're a wimp looking for attention. A study at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada proves that marijuana actually stimulates brain cell growth (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/ 2005/10/051016083817.htm). Again, marijuana ENHANCES both sides of the brain  by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system (http://deanna-roddy.suite101.com/ the-pros-and-cons-of-marijuana-use-is-i t-a-safer-alternative-a241045). Furthermore, a study conducted in America (http://beforeitsnews. com/story/1530/375/ Study:_Smoking_Marijuana_Improves_ Driving_Skills.html)  showed  the use of medical marijuana has caused traffic related fatalities to fall by nearly nine percent in states that have legalized medical marijuana.

Marijuana effects the perception of time, distance, and speed. It upsets motor coordination, causing unsteady hands, a change in gait, uncontrolled laughter, and a lag between thought and facial expressions. Sexual functions can also be disturbed. Short-term memory deteriorates. In early stages of the use of marijuana, some users will suffer from nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most users may find that when they are high the whites of their eyes and facial skin become red, and the pupils dilate and become sensitive to light, increase in appetite, and a dryness in the mouth and throat. What all these effects have in common is that they result from changes in the brain's control centers, located deep in the brain. ",

Maybe it's in my head, but none of you have the right to put me through that just so that you can say you can get baked legally.  At least cigars and cigarettes odors dissipate fairly quickly, and their odor, while somewhat bad, are not sharp bad pungent odors that carry down the street and waft through people's windows.  Geez, I can't even have my window open sometimes on a warm summer night or a decent time in my backyard on a Friday night because of my next door neighbor who doesn't seem to care that the odor is very strong across the fence in my yard.  It's ridiculous really. Not to mention, with all the problems we have with the mind-altering substance called alcohol, we'd be opening a whole new host of problems if marijuana were legalized, not to mention the public health concern. I know, I know, Marijuana only alters the mind and it has no harmful fumes, yeah, well, wait until it goes public and it's everywhere, I think we'll find, as we do with almost everything, it's not what we assumed it would be.

And imagine someone who happens to be very allergic to the stuff, you can smell that stuff from several yards away, and in some cases as far as football field or more if the wind is just right.   I have no issues with it being legalized for people to do on their own, away from the public, but that's not what will happen is it. No, what will happen is people will test their boundaries, insist that it can be smoked anywhere regardless of who is affected by it, and that will go on for a while until it's finally brought to court, and years later legislation is finally made that says it can't be smoked in public places or where it causes other discomfort. Then people will fight that saying that there are not harmful side-effects, if in fact we don't discover any, which we won't at first, and they will attempt to smoke it in places where others are affected by it anyway.   And then we've proven how responsible we are with legal mind-altering substances by how we use alcohol. Some of us are while many others of them are not, and really, to legalize marijuana would mean a whole new era of legislation to control everyone that would not regard others in their use of the substance.

There are ways, maybe too primitive for this generation of \"successful actors\" and counters to accept, but it's far more effective in the long run and you have a better understanding shit while you're doing it and afterwords too... it's called \"discipline\". A trick that seems to be all but forgotten, today... I wonder if it's because anyone can just go grab some form of \"medication\" to make themselves appreciate their own work and the world around them.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- -----------    Honestly, I find it both morally and ethically corrupt to even desire a substance for pleasure, let alone demand it come easier. The ultimate weakness and surest sign of gluttony, bitching about your unnecessary substances.   \"I know many, many, many other people that fit this criteria as well.\"   So what? Many, many, many other people strive to define humanity as something other than a waste of billions of years of evolution and suffering for burnt plant fumes that create a careless and happy go lucky floaty feeling.   I'm one of those people that know the meaning and worth of discipline. There's something sacred about reality and the way that the earth is when it's \"dull\" and quiet that no one seems to get... everything needs to be brilliantly colorful, exciting, relaxing, whatever, some form of artificial stimulation needs to be administered to get any good experience out of anything.

But we can't, so we can't exactly drink, now can we? That would require an irresponsible adult. :)  I highly doubt marijuana would spark a billion dollar industry.

Marijuana has a track record of being the safest drug around, safer even then alcohol.  Furthermore, the argument that terrorist groups benefit from the marijuana trade is just a myth. Most street-level cannabis dealers would get their product from someone who grows it in the same country - the profit margin of cannabis is small compared to other drugs so importing it is usually not financially worthwhile. Also, you're forgetting that ending the prohibition of marijuana would cut these suppliers out of the system and force them to go legit. Alcohol prohibition in the '30s forced alcohol into the hands of organised crime, and provided them with a source of income as well as putting the general population in danger of an unregulated alcohol market. Once the prohibition was lifted this took away the criminals' largest source of income and allowed the government to control the standards of alcoholic drinks. The same principle applies here - organised criminals would have one less source of income, and the rumoured 'dangerously strong strains of cannabis' could be outlawed so companies growing the plant would only sell it at a sensible and controlled strength.  Also, your argument about cannabis users experimenting with other drugs such as cocaine and heroin: this 'gateway drug' argument is simply unusable in the argument concerning legalisation because legalisation would remove the drug's gateway effects. The idea of cannabis being a gateway drug stems from the idea that, in pursuit of buying cannabis, an individual would associate themselves with the people who sell it: criminals. Drug dealers (like any businessman) naturally want to maximise their profit so they would offer up a stronger drug later on. The lack of distinction between cannabis and stronger drugs (because they're all illegal anyway) would mean the user is more open to trying these drugs. Legalisation would not only remove the criminal market but would also create a visible barrier between what is safe to try and what isn't.  In conclusion, the legalisation of marijuana would be, ultimately, a harm reduction measure. Gangs would lose a source of income and would become less powerful, users would no longer have to associate with criminals, and for once the population of what is meant to be a free country would have the power to make a decision that affects no-one but themselves. That isn't even touching on the other benefits of legalisation, including freeing up space in the over-crowded prison system, providing an additional source of government income in the form of tax and freeing up police time to tackle violent crimes.",

Someone who is high on Marijuana is not going to rob a bank, or steal a car, however there is a good chance they will sit on the couch and stare in amazement as a piece of lint floats by, or watch a movie about talking animals.

Do you know of anyone who has been fired for marijuana use?   Not personally, no.   There's a lot of companies that would fire people for that even if it wasn't illegal.   SO???

Desperate people, will sometimes do desperate (and often illegal) things, such as stealing a car....therefore we should outlaw cars. Following your logic.  Prohibition obviously doesn't work, which is why so many people still do marijuana, many people are sitting behind bars (costing taxpayer dollars) who should not be there in the first place.

Recently a bill was introduced into the California Legislature that called for the legalization of Marijuana in the state. In the bill it stated that the industry created from this would bring in more that a billion dollars in tax revenue. That's just the tax revenue it would generate and just in California.  As to your point about private growers:  Do you grow your own food?.... I rest my case. It's a matter of convenience. Some will do it ,yes, but most won't.  And people can and do grow their own tobacco. I have a few friends who carry around a bag of tobacco and rolling papers for cigarettes precisely for the reason you stated.

      "comment": "When it comes to my point of view on the legalization of Marijuana I believe that there is no reason what so ever for it to remain illegal.  I'm not going to go into detail explaining what many have already said, about the medical uses, stress relief, etc, but when it comes to the profit that could be made this way, an enormous amount of opportunities open up.  First thing that comes to mind with the legal sale of Marijuana is tax. Why have a tax other then sales tax? Hell, why not? Are you not willing to pay that extra amount to be able to legally smoke? Is that extra tax not worth being able to sit in clear view and toke it up without worrying about going to jail if you're caught? Of course it is!  Realistically, we could add the Cigarette tax from each state onto a package of Joints. 4 average rolled joints at $10 + tax. Sure, you're getting slightly less than a dime's worth, but again, that extra amount is more than worth it.  If marijuana was to be considered for legalization, and lets say they were to use Texas as the Beta-State, a package of 4 joints would cost $11.41 after tax. Lets say Joe goes through the average dime in about 2 days. That's 178 dime bags in a year. As of now that would cost him $1780, and it would cost $2030.98 if it was legalized and taxed. That is $250.98 more than he would normally pay for a slightly less amount of weed. About .1 gram per package to be exact,  That is $250.98 in profit to the government, in 1 year, from 1 man. That means slightly under 4000 people (3985) would allow the government to make a profit of one million dollars.  Did I mention that is in addition to the money saved yearly on arrest and court costs? Imagine this... 6458 (adjusted for the California cigarette tax) people in California smoke marijuana once it has become legalized. That's $1 million in profit, in addition to saving the $100 million that it is estimated to spend yearly on arrest and court costs. I'm failing to see the problem with this idea.  On a large scale, I think I read somewhere about 10% of the American population admitted to smoking marijuana. The last estimated count was about 303.8 million people in the US, so 30.38 million have admitted to regular use. The average tax on cigarettes around the US is about $.53 per pack, at even just 1 dime per week, equals to an average profit of $837.27 million dollars annually.  This estimate does not include the millions of Americans who did not admit to their regular use, nor to the hundreds of millions that would be saved on arrest and court costs.  In addition, think of all the new job openings of adding several large scale marijuana plantations. Hundreds of job possibilities open up, allowing the percentage of jobless adults to decrease. Hell, make a few new college courses about Marijuana History, Growing Marijuana, the Cultivation of Marijuana. Easily opening up new job opportunities for people to strive for. Sure, it's not the perfect job, but if you can convince people to go to school for it, and make a college degree required to work on the plantation, I bet it would convince hundreds of students to return to school with their career choice in mind.  All of these are just estimates and I have no way of knowing any exacts. But as my estimates are reasonable, and pretty close to being exact with the information I've researched, even if it didn't provide an adequate source to replace paper products, or medical uses, or any of the other dozen + things that marijuana is useful for, the profit in taxes and the annual savings in court costs and the job opportunities more than justify the legalization of marijuana.",

But as my estimates are reasonable, and pretty close to being exact with the information I've researched, even if it didn't provide an adequate source to replace paper products, or medical uses, or any of the other dozen + things that marijuana is useful for, the profit in taxes and the annual savings in court costs and the job opportunities more than justify the legalization of marijuana.",

When a person is high, he or she is not fully functional. Most daily alcohol drinkers do not drink to get drunk, they drink until they're relaxed, that is one reason alcohol is legal. Marijuana is unfiltered and will cause lung damage as well as tobacco, however tobacco does not affect how you function while marijuana does (as previously stated). Marijuana also has proven to take a permanent toll on the adolescent brain. It has proven poorer performance on thinking tasks, slower motor skill speed, poor attention span, poor verbal memory, and planning ability. Even with 3 weeks of abstinence of Marijuana, attention span is permanently affected but motor skills, planning ability, and thinking tasks have slightly increased but are still affected. With Marijuana use, the brain is working harder than it should causing stress, shorter life span, and a weaker body in the long run. Though Marijuana has proven to help slow down medical issues, it still only slows down, does not cure the medical issue. Same goes with prescription medicine. Most of them only slow down your issue, not get rid of it. The reason prescription medicines are legal is because your doctor needs to allow you to take it. I'm fine if you use marijuana because your doctor prescribes it to you, however most of the time, that is not the case and Marijuana is abused by many teens and young adults. There is a reason the future of America (and the world) is going downhill. The increased Marijuana use in high school and middle schoolers is one of the main reasons.",

When a person is high, he or she is not fully functional. Most daily alcohol drinkers do not drink to get drunk, they drink until they're relaxed, that is one reason alcohol is legal. Marijuana is unfiltered and will cause lung damage as well as tobacco, however tobacco does not affect how you function while marijuana does (as previously stated). Marijuana also has proven to take a permanent toll on the adolescent brain. It has proven poorer performance on thinking tasks, slower motor skill speed, poor attention span, poor verbal memory, and planning ability. Even with 3 weeks of abstinence of Marijuana, attention span is permanently affected but motor skills, planning ability, and thinking tasks have slightly increased but are still affected. With Marijuana use, the brain is working harder than it should causing stress, shorter life span, and a weaker body in the long run. Though Marijuana has proven to help slow down medical issues, it still only slows down, does not cure the medical issue. Same goes with prescription medicine. Most of them only slow down your issue, not get rid of it. The reason prescription medicines are legal is because your doctor needs to allow you to take it. I'm fine if you use marijuana because your doctor prescribes it to you, however most of the time, that is not the case and Marijuana is abused by many teens and young adults. There is a reason the future of America (and the world) is going downhill. The increased Marijuana use in high school and middle schoolers is one of the main reasons.",

Although it is true that being high is kind of similar to being drunk there are some significant differences; marijuana makes things feel, for lack of a better term, sillier. Alcohol on the other hand, when used in excess can lead to blacking out, vomiting and not remembering what happened. In this way alcohol is significantly more dangerous. Whereas you can die from alcohol intoxication, too much marijuana really can't hurt you. Also, most of the negative feelings associated with alcohol, such as guilt and regret, are typically not experienced when using marijuana. We have also seen what happens when you make alcohol illegal: organized crime grew significantly in major cities because they were able to make an absurd amount of money selling bootleg liquor. Comparing alcohol to marijuana in this context would be accurate. The selling of marijuana by gangs is very profitable. You say that we should go down to Mexico to smoke but I live in Delaware and if I want to smoke with my friends going to Mexico for a weekend isn't a viable option. Instead I would have to find a drug dealer. This puts money in the hands of bad people. Legalization would put a stop to this.  Finally, for someone who claims to love the USA so much you seem to be okay with suppressing freedoms. The reason Mexico is different from the US is because they are relatively poor, their government is corrupt, and crime is rampant. Keeping marijuana illegal only helps criminals, so if you want the US to not be like Mexico then you should encourage the legalization of marijuana.",

Although it is true that being high is kind of similar to being drunk there are some significant differences; marijuana makes things feel, for lack of a better term, sillier. Alcohol on the other hand, when used in excess can lead to blacking out, vomiting and not remembering what happened. In this way alcohol is significantly more dangerous. Whereas you can die from alcohol intoxication, too much marijuana really can't hurt you. Also, most of the negative feelings associated with alcohol, such as guilt and regret, are typically not experienced when using marijuana. We have also seen what happens when you make alcohol illegal: organized crime grew significantly in major cities because they were able to make an absurd amount of money selling bootleg liquor. Comparing alcohol to marijuana in this context would be accurate. The selling of marijuana by gangs is very profitable. You say that we should go down to Mexico to smoke but I live in Delaware and if I want to smoke with my friends going to Mexico for a weekend isn't a viable option. Instead I would have to find a drug dealer. This puts money in the hands of bad people. Legalization would put a stop to this.  Finally, for someone who claims to love the USA so much you seem to be okay with suppressing freedoms. The reason Mexico is different from the US is because they are relatively poor, their government is corrupt, and crime is rampant. Keeping marijuana illegal only helps criminals, so if you want the US to not be like Mexico then you should encourage the legalization of marijuana.",

It's just much more dangerous and expensive to do so because it's illegal.  I believe the core of our disagreement here seems to be that we have opposing viewpoints on marijuana alone, whereas you seem to think of it as something bad; some kind of scourge of society. I don't see it that way. There has been endless debate over whether or not marijuana is harmful, and I choose to believe it's really not that bad. Either way, it should be a level-minded individual's choice to smoke marijuana, just like it's their choice if they wish to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol, both very destructive substances, yet still legal. My core belief is that it should be the individual's choice whether to do something or not.  Although there is some small chance that you are  not  calling me a pothead, let's get something straight; I've never smoked marijuana, I've never done any other drug, I don't drink alcohol, I don't smoke cigarettes, and to be honest, I really don't plan on doing any of the above. I've made it thus far without them, and I don't have any real reason to start now. So, because of this, I can say that I have reasoning beyond what is simply personally more convenient.  The war on marijuana, not all drugs, but marijuana, sucks up  so much  federal, state, and local money. Couldn't this money be better spent enforcing the other laws, say, the ones that keep people under the influence off the roads?

All this still happens, but because it is illegal, it takes place less often. Don't people still sell marijuana and don't people still smoke it? Yes, they do. It's just much more dangerous and expensive to do so because it's illegal.  I believe the core of our disagreement here seems to be that we have opposing viewpoints on marijuana alone, whereas you seem to think of it as something bad; some kind of scourge of society. I don't see it that way. There has been endless debate over whether or not marijuana is harmful, and I choose to believe it's really not that bad. Either way, it should be a level-minded individual's choice to smoke marijuana, just like it's their choice if they wish to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol, both very destructive substances, yet still legal. My core belief is that it should be the individual's choice whether to do something or not.  Although there is some small chance that you are  not  calling me a pothead, let's get something straight; I've never smoked marijuana, I've never done any other drug, I don't drink alcohol, I don't smoke cigarettes, and to be honest, I really don't plan on doing any of the above. I've made it thus far without them, and I don't have any real reason to start now. So, because of this, I can say that I have reasoning beyond what is simply personally more convenient.   The war on marijuana, not all drugs, but marijuana, sucks up  so much  federal, state, and local money. Couldn't this money be better spent enforcing the other laws, say, the ones that keep people under the influence off the roads? Or maybe we could put this money towards something we can all enjoy, like lowering taxes. There are just better ways to spend our money.  You make good points, and I understand what you are getting at, I just wholeheartedly disagree.",

This would stop people from dying when their drugs have been modified in an unhealthy way. Second, we could tax the heck out of it. It's not the best solution, but it would help curb the government's budget problems. What about Industrial Hemp? That would help create a billion dollar industry, hence more jobs, and more money if the US exports and or imports it to different countries.  Hemp is good for as a alternative fuel, food, clothing, paper, etc. That would help our environment greatly. Why cut down trees that takes over 80 years to fully grow while you can use hemp that fully grows per season?What about the waste of tax payers money called the war on drugs? It's a completely useless program that helps create more chaos by making drug cartels being stinking rich, do you really want the drug cartels to have such power?  Bad things:  Marijuana is proven to cause depression and change brain patterns in odd ways among other things. But there are many worse drugs. However if Marijuana was legalized there would be a push to legalize other drugs. Things like Meth and Estacy could be legalized, then we could say goodbye to civilization as we know it. Even if other drugs werent legalized after, Marijuana its still a gateway to a high feeling. And many, too many, will want to move on to larger highs, to drugs which have undoubtedly negative effects, to drugs which will annihilate your ability to think and function.   So, in the end, my thoughts are not to legalize it, but to decriminalize it. It could be decriminalized for say, a personal amount. If you're caught over that amount you receive a fine. Charging and convicting people for personal amounts is a waste of tax money and court time. Nobody has ever died directly related to marijuana.

You also seem to think I am saying it would be okay to do leisurely activities while on the job which I didn't. However if your responsibilities are finished it is better you enjoy yourself than be a robot who thinks its wrong to enjoy things be it cannabis, alcohol, food, sex, whatever. Either way, ethics or morals it doesn't matter I still don't see why someone else ought to live by your personal ethics/morals.  And your correct that leisure does not require marijuana however some people enjoy using marijuana in their leisure time. And unless we want to set up a draconian system to make all pleasures wrong (which you would probably support) it is hypocritical to allow some substances and not others, especially if those other substances are less harmful.  You still have not given a reason to keep drugs illegal. It is an inconsistent argument and if we want to start taking away one persons right to what they enjoy in their spare time when will it stop? I may not know what you personally enjoy but I should not have the right to deprive you of your enjoyment if your not harming anyone else.  As far as a study that proves happier workers are more productive here is one of the first articles that came up with google, mind you I didn't search for long...   http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/workinglife/article990727.ece    The use of marijuana hurts no one but the individual who choses to use it. Why should it be anyone else's choice whether they hurt themselves or not. And if they do abuse marijuana to the point of harming themselves how is it the substances fault? Should we criminalize knives because I could possibly slit my own wrists? I really don't believe your completely consistent with your line of thinking. But you could be. My question is who gets to determine these arbitrary rules? Because that is all drug criminalization is, for the most part just a random arbitrary law for no reason other than control.",

      "comment": "Recent studies that were highlighted in the BBC3 UK documentary \"Should I smoke Pot?\" showed marijuana is actually more dangerous than I previously believed. The really interesting point the documentary highlighted was the risk of psychosis from taking the drug where the THC content was very high. In one session a test subject rated a 14 for psychosis, it was highlighted that a 1 or 2 was normal and above a 4 was generally considered to be in the ballpark of the schizophrenic.  Why am I bringing this up when I'm against criminalising the drug? The answer really lies in how people get hold of marijuana in the first place. People will, no matter what the law tries to enforce, use marijuana for recreational and medicinal purposes. With that said these users have no real access to quality control over their drug. They can get hold of very high THC content skunk which can quickly make them paranoid and prone to all the negative effects of psychosis. Where they may be better choosing a much lower THC variety imported.  If the drug were controlled, distributed legally and taxed. The levels could be monitored, the dealers, many of whom are dealing in harder drugs and offering those up too would be out of business overnight. This would sever the link some users have who are suggestable to moving onto harder drugs. Also de-criminalising the drug will make it easier to treat people who do end up abusing it and need help. If you have a drink problem today, you can turn to friends and family as well as your doctor. If you're a \"druggy\" you're very unlikely to get any help from anyone, making any problem you might develop possibly worse.  With everything legal and marijuana available in cafes (as they are in Amsterdam for instance) the public can be educated on what the real side effects of the drugs are, what the benefits are and have the ability to choose wisely on various strains to find one that suits that person. Just as I might end up finding out I prefer shandy when I go to bars. A mixture of beer and lemonade which makes it less alcoholic.   Finally I think the children would benefit too. If it became socially acceptable to smoke pot in special cafes open only to adults then children would not have easy access as they do now with all the street dealers around.",

Whether it is more or less harmful than other legal drugs doesn't make a difference. It is illegal because of the negative effects it has on your body. To argue that, \"that isn't fair because alcohol and tobacco\" is stupid to say. My reasoning behind this is that alcohol and tobacco aren't illegal because to try to make something illegal that has been legal for so long is nearly impossible.

The government has no say in what someone should do with their body as long as it's not infringing on anyone else's rights.  as far as driving high goes -  http://www.break.com/usercontent/2007/7/                                        Dr...igh-339007.html",

As we mature, our neurons deposit a compound called myelin around the axon of a dendrite. These myelin deposits are known as Schwann cells and their purpose is to make transmitting information quicker. Electrical impulses simply skip over these sections and go from node to node much quicker than if they weren't there.

There will be (HOPEFULLY!) a vast majority of people who don't smoke, if and when marijuana becomes legalized. Just because a lot of people drink doesn't mean everyone does. Just because a lot of people smoke cigarettes doesn't mean every person does. And just because a lot of people overeat certainly does not mean that everyone does. Consider athletes, for example. I'm not so sure that if it actually is legalized everything will be perfect, but then again nothing is, really. If one looks at alcohol there is still a giant reoccuring problem with drinking and driving. Despite educational tools used in schools, teens still do it; even adults do.

It would provide jobs across the country, provide hemp crops for textile use, and would provide large amounts of tourism revenue from potheads worldwide.  It provides an extra source of taxation for the government (they can tax pot as heavily as they do with cigarettes).   It also removes a major gateway to other more dangerous illegal substances.  Pot is possible to saliva test roadside, thus providing another area for the government to pull revenue from (drug driving).

I used to as a teenager but stopped due to the fact that it is illegal. But I am still in favor of its recreational use because, in my opinion, it is not as dangerous as other already legal substances (tobacco, alcohol). I mean, hey! If these substances are legal, why can't marijuana be as well? It doesn't cause a strong physical addiction like other substances, it doesn't induce violent behavior, it awakens creativity, it's completely natural, etc.   Another point is that I think the legalization of marijuana could put an end to the harmful effects of illegal trafficking. The war between drug cartels and police have caused way too many deaths worldwide. We have already seen the effects of prohibition on alcohol. When prohibition was lifted, there was less violence on the streets due to the fact that the trafficking stopped. Why can't we do the same with the trafficking situation between Mexico and the US?  I also think that the legalization of marijuana would be good for the economy. It would create a new work industry therefore more jobs available to the people. Like tobacco, it could be heavily taxed and provide more money for the Federal Reserve (I'm not sure that is a good thing).  So, there's my argument. Anyone beg to differ?",

The persecution of the half-a-million strong hippies assembled in August 1969 can\u00e2t be good for America, the world-leader in percentile behind bars. Madam Secretary Clinton need not travel to Tibet to find a minority subculture stripped of human rights. If we are all about spreading liberty abroad, then why mix the message at home? Peace on the home front would enhance credibility.  Stop throwing good money after bad. The witch-hunt doctor\u00e2s Rx is for every bust to numerate a bigger tax-load over a smaller denominator of payers. Spend more on prisons than on schools. My shaman\u00e2s second opinion is homegrown herbal remedy. Consumer dollars can stimulate the economy better if they aren\u00e2t depleted by prohibition\u00e2s black market.  Only a clause about interstate commerce provides a shred of constitutionality. The commerce policy on the number-one cash crop in the land is no taxation; yes eradication. But money to frustrate enforcement grows on trees. Did the authors of the Constitution intend to divert the Treasury\u00e2s natural revenue to Mexican cartels? America rejected prohibition, but its back. Swat teams don\u00e2t seem to need no stinking amendment.  The demonized substances never had their day in court. Nixon promised to supply supporting evidence later. Later, the Commission evidence didn\u00e2t support, but no matter. The witch-hunt was on. No amendments can assure due-process under an anti-science law that never had any due-process itself.

The only function of our government is to maintain a robust economy. Most everything can be understood under this one assumption. The main goal of our government is to keep us preoccupied, to keep us serving the economy by producing and consuming. Our government is a client of corporations. It's another tool that large businesses use to reach their goals. They invest in government like they invest in a business venture, with the expectation that it will make them more money.   A requirement of this ever churning, ever expanding economy is the passivity of its participants' inquiries and the maintenance of their blind actions. This brings me to my conclusion. When you smoke marijuana, you start to think more about the requirements of your brain and your mind (What do I truly NEED?) You start to ask questions like, \"Do I really need that many THINGS?\", \"Is it natural to be obligated to a flourescently lit office building for 40 hrs every week of your life to basically move paper from one place to another, to be treated like a child whose time is monitored, and reprimanded by a \"boss\"?\" \"Do I get meaning from my life or am I just a cog in the wheel of this economy, eg. is it essential for the universe to contain operating services clerical specialists?\" \"Why can't I grow a plant in my backyard, but I can be on numerous synthetic prescription medications?\"  There are other reasons that marijuana should be legal or at least decriminalized, but I believe this is the biggest obstacle: We might actually wake up and analyze what our lives are, what consequences our behaviors have on ourselves, our neighbors, and the rest of the world. We might stop consuming.",
