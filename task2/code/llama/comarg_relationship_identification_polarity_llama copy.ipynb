      "9arg7 America is not built on religious theology. It was suppose to be a place where EVERYONE can practice their own beliefs and religion; you cannot force anyone to practice your religion. For a Buddhist, Christian values, the bible are nothing. For an Atheist, nothing. This country separates the church and state; you cannot stop gay marriages with arguments of religion.   Some people are arguing that gay marriages should be stopped because they cannot produce children. Neither can infertile straight couples. And neither will straight couples who don't WANT children but CAN. What is the point of this argument when these straight couples won't be producing any children? Are we going to value people by what they CAN do? In that case, why not get rid of and kill all the disabled, the elderly, terminally ill patients, the mentally ill, the homeless, and everybody and anyone who can't be a potential benefit to society?

      "12arg7 Being gay is something you are born with you cant wake up one day and say  im gonna be gay. thats like saying one day your are just gonna be black or white  or asian. Not allowing gays to marry is cruel and unjust they are people just like you and me. they feel the same thing that we feel. allowing the banning of same sex marriage is saying its okay to hate against someone wo is different. america is about accepting people for who they are and allowng them to live freely.  people say it is against God's will. maybe it is but we are not God and souldnt judge. in the bible it says only God can judge others not us. let them live there lives without judgment and them being marked as outsiders. Marriage should be between a man and a woman\n"

      "23arg6 For Christians, the bible is clear.  The covenant of marriage is between God, a man and a woman.  Christian gays need to acknowledge this and make the decision themselves as to whether they want to willfully engage a non-binding covenant.  Enacting a non-binding covenant with God is virtually a non-covenant, so why bother.  Holding out the belief that you are entitled to do so, is no more different that being a non-perfect Christian, which is 100% of all Christians, and effectively no different theologically, than atheist getting married.  That being said, a government should not use the theological argument, unless they are a theocracy.  I don't think that our government is (anymore).  Legal standing is between people and their government, spiritual covenants between people and God are something personal and should be untouchable by government. Marriage is about more than procreation, therefore gay couples should not be denied the right to marry due to their biology.\n"

      "34arg5 Gay people do not have a disorder, rather we all are sinners, and some people struggle with different sins more than others. it is silly to say gay people can't get married because they can't have children. The only real argument against gay marriage is that it is unnatural as described in Romans 1:26-27 and at least three other verses. Yes, Christians are commanded to love, but not in a homosexual way. There's a difference between loving your girlfriend or boyfriend and loving people as stipulated in 1 Corinthians 13:4-8. Other less important arguments that can be made is that a homosexual relationship can be physically unhealthy, but smoking is unhealthy, and people still do that. Furthermore, the Bible does not say to avoid judging in Matthew 7:2-6, because it says to not cast your pearls before swine and such (please no one assume I'm saying that anybody is swine; I would not do that ever); showing that you must first determine who the swine are, but ultimately, God is the only one who should judge, because he is perfect. Bottom line, we all need Jesus! Nobody needs him more than another! God's word is truth! (John 14:6) I'm a sinner that deserves to go to Hell, but I'm saved by grace! Major world religions are against gay marriages\n"

The world is coming to an end and in the bible it is said that the sins of the people will grow and this is happening. We dont want our children growing up and thinking that oh its okay to marry somone of their own sex. Next think you know our children will be getting married with animals. Like me some people dont want gay marriage to be allowed and we want our rights to be respected. Like in the word of God it is said that he created a women so the man wouldnt be alone he never said he created women so the womwn wouldnt be alone. Like I said in the beginig yhe world is coming to an end and Gods arrival is getting close and does who didnt follow his law and acepted him as his saviour will not be welcomed to heaven.

My point is, people who are against people like my moms that mock and tease us (even my sister and me,even though we both are strait) learn that they are just in love and are only trying to get the rights they deserve. Same gender marriage should be legalized to get the same benefits that normal marriages get. don't be ignorant. don't mock my family, we didn't do anything wrong. thank you for your time if you have read this. Marriage should be between a man and a woman\n"

      "50arg7 I am against gay marriage because I try to do as Jesus Christ taught in John 13; Love one another; as I have loved you.  I believe that the love that Christ taught in this scripture is a love based on wanting the best for an individual.  I think most of the public today believes in 'tolerance' more than 'love', but I will not follow this pattern.  Homosexual relationships are strictly banned in The Bible in Romans 1:27, as well as in other verses, and I believe that making something that God has spoken against legal would be very disrespectful to Him and His infinite love for us. Marriage should be between a man and a woman\n"

SO legally making all states that agree to a legal nationally life partners law also may give the gays more protection from from physical abuse by hate crimes Nationally Legaly More Enforced EASIER and it also would give them Domiestic Violence Protection within this proposed Nationally Legaly Life Partners  law that I feel would be more nationally acceptable. Plus, this is much easier to identify gay couples who also have health insurance needs that actually live healthier life styles in same states than heterosexuals.

It was a religious institution before we roped it in with benefits. So why don't we not put marriage under the law (by under the law, I mean with the documents, and sharing benefits, etc). How about if there is a want to be legally joined together the US calls it a civil union. Everyone gets one who wants to be together. Then, if one is religious, they can perform their own religious ceremony, whether it is a marriage in a church, or something else. This way everyone is equal (everyone gets a civil union), there is a separation of church and state (civil union under the state, and a religious ceremony under church), yet marriage retains it's sacredness for the Christians. Everyone is happy. Major world religions are against gay marriages\n"

      "69arg7 I hear a lot of Pro comments that wonder why so many Christians have an opinion.  Well first off, the homosexual movement has tried to take a Christian symbol which is the rainbow which represents God's covenant with His people and make it as their symbol.  And now the homosexual movement wants to have the same respect as heterosexuals by legalizing their marriage and claiming that there is no difference between the two.  Homosexuals have rights and laws protecting them against discrimination.  They have the right to choose who they want to express their sexuality with.  Discrimination is not the issue and whether God is for or against it is not the issue either.  The issue is whether or not homosexuality affects society and whether there should be a law protecting it.  Well first off if everyone was a homosexual no one would be alive.  Secondly, some psychologist say that pedophiles are born pedophiles and that is not accepted nor should it be. The question is not are they born this way, the question is how does this behavior affect society.  Plain and simple, heterosexual marriage is the safest way to engage in sexuality and everything else is risky behavior and there should not be laws protecting it. Marriage should be between a man and a woman\n"

If love should know no age, color, heritage, then it shouldn't know gender either. The Pilgrims came here on a mission to be free of religion telling them what to do and the government dictating their lives. So why should we be doing what is against the Constitution? If people are able to say what they want, they should be able to marry whom they want without the government getting in their way. The government should be totally separate from religion as stated in our constitution as well. People should be able to be who they are and not have to hide their true self from everyone as in a dictatorship, nor should they have to hide the fact that they are homosexual as if they will be exterminated for being so. Marriage should be between a man and a woman\n"

      "85arg7 If we address gay marriage on the basis of religion then yes it is considered wrong. but fact is no two people are going to have the same identical beliefs. some would say there is no  god and others say there is. I believe there is and he loved and accepted everyone regardless of one's sexual desire and so should we. Yes we do not have to promote gay marriage  neither support it but I strongly feel that if two people want to marry and are the same sex then it really isn't the same as two of opposite sex. Why? Simple reason marriage combines the forms of male and female not just for bearing children but it's a psychological thing.  A guy needs a girl to support him and understand him and listen to his problem; and a female needs a guy to support her and provide for her in ways she cannot provide for herself. Note that these are my views on the topic and I'm allowed to voice an opinion in a respectful way :D But I'm sure I'll have a few silly comments saying Why do you care? I don't if Jenna  Monique want to be together fine. That's their choice in the end we all have to answer to someone after we take our last breath. Also I'll add this just because you choose not to believe in something doesn't mean it's not true. Marriage should be between a man and a woman\n"

      "89arg7 In light of our recent celebration of Mother's Day, think about all of the children who can't say Happy Mother's Day, either because of the lack of a mom, or even more pressing, the lack of child. It is not illogical that man + man = no offspring. I agree with a large consensus of people, everyone deserves the right to love who they want; but when did men start loving men? It is a distortion of what real love is. God made a woman for a man. It was never, and I say this with utmost sincerity, Adam and Steve. And maybe you are an evolutionist or a big bang theorist (not sure of the technical name), but that still doesn't subtract from the age-old truth that, no matter how we got here, it has always been a man and a woman in holy matrimony until more recent centuries where people have slowly started distorting this reality in favor of something contemporary and new, like gay marriage. Marriage should be between a man and a woman\n"

Statistics show the divorce rate dropped 21% between the years 2003 and 2008, giving it the lowest divorce rate in the country.

The soul of man (created by the creator), invisible to normal human vision because it is comprised of more subtle substance than human flesh, is contacted by the human mother who becomes a conduit, or who touches that (soul) realm (now we know why sex is sacred and so we may understand why some scriptures prescribe severe penalties for RAPE - the victim's soul is interfered with, thereby). Two same-sex people cannot do that ON THEIR OWN. Fertilized egg implants or any type of engineering does not alter the fact that the Mercy of The Creator is NOT extended to them in that regard, nor can they have that type of access.   Now, don't get me wrong.  This is not hate; simply facts as I see them. Therefore it is best to let them continue in their folly, BUT,  they are not to indoctrinate others, especially our children, nor are they to be granted any special rights. They already have the constitution. Let us be careful. Could THIS be a plot to make it  EASIER to conquer mankind by causing us to descend to ungodly considerations and principles?

      "106arg7 Marriage is a privilege granted by the government with many stipulations. Love has never been a factor. Marriage is divided among gender lines, not love lines, because only men and women can reproduce. In a time when many countries are facing below-replacement birth rates, we should be encouraging marriage, not dividing and weakening it.  Gay marriage advocates use emotional rhetoric to bypass the fact that children raised by gays are more likely to be gay themselves. Common sense demands it, and studies prove it. Sexuality is in large part a learned trait, and can be influenced over time just like someone's weight. Furthermore, the (primarily atheist) forces behind gay marriage seek to end marriage completely, since they see it as a religious ideology. This is shown by the low proportion of gay marriages performed and children raised in countries where gay marriage has been legal for some time.   It is not an accident that marriage has been between men and women for all of human history. Gay marriage advocates are not original in their beliefs. Other societies have tried to change marriage to suit their beliefs, and they have either stagnated or failed. More research and less rhetoric is needed in order to make a smart decision. Marriage should be between a man and a woman\n"

There are actually many self proclaimed homosexuals who do currently engage in traditional marriage (and raise families, etc.) This is proof that homosexuals are not restricted from marriage (as defined between man and woman) I truly believe that the powers behind the cause to re-define marriage stem from a stronger desire to attack a religious institution that does not support homosexuality, rather than a desire to achieve the same benefits as marriage for same sex couples.

Even if you do not believe in him, you must know that gay marriage will only split society in half between those who supported it and those who do not. Even now we are split upon the issue. People of homosexuality do not need to marry, they should be happy with what they already have. Marriage should only be allowed to those of heterosexuality.

Why should public resources support typical LGBTQ behaviors such as sodomy, abortion, disease proliferation, and pornography? Why should the public support any LGBTQ Diversity schemes? LGBTQ are well known leaders of abortion on demand. It is fairly ridiculous to grant a marriage license, originally public support for raising children, to people that promote infanticide. With all of the recent news of homosexual child molestation and multi-drug resistant diseses associated with HIV infection, it makes zero sense to support LGBTQ behaviors. The public puts prostitutes in jail for doing less vile things than LGBTQ. Why grant a license for licentiousness?

      "148arg7 The ideal setting in which to raise a child is with a Mother and a Father. The human genome has been mapped and no gay gene was found. Any reputable biologist, psychologist, et al., will tell you there are variety of reasons why people engage in homosexual behavior. Homosexuals shouldn't be absued, demeaned, etc. However, most homosexuals do not actually want to get married. There are already many benefits afforded to homosexuals (domestic partnership benefits, they're allowed to enter into contracts, etc.). It appears that the real reason this is being pushed as some urgent civil right is not because of a real need or desire, but a desire to elevate homosexual behavior with that of (universally accepted) male and female union. Children deserve to be raised in healthy environments. People deserve to hear the truth about the unhealthy effects (physcial and emotional) of homosexual behavior. Lastly, God does exist, His Word is true and if this nation or any other turns its back on Him, we are doomed (whether any of you like it, believe it, or want to believe it). Thank you for reading this. Thank God for the freedom to say what we believe. If you don't agree with me on this, let's agree that's great that we can say what we think Marriage should be between a man and a woman\n"

Prior to that, marriages were planned by two families for financial, political and other reasons.  Little input was allowed from the groom-to-be and no input from the bride-to-be.  This type of marriage is still practiced in several parts of the world.  Women were/are seen as chattel, something to be used in bargaining not unlike a prized cow or a fecund mare.  Is this what those against same-sex marriage really want to bring back?  As to the need for both a male and a female, a father and a mother, to breed and rear children:  where do the hundreds of thousands of single-parent families fit?  As with straight parents, same-sex parents are equally concerned for and participate in the lives of their children.  Multiple studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents do as well as those from a straight home; sometimes they do even better.  I have a goodly number of friends in committed relationships (two going back over 40 years) who have children;  these kids are brought up in a warm, supportive, loving home.  Each of these kids (aged 6 months to 42 years) is a wonderful person; the older guys and girls are happy, productive, loving members of society in school and at work.  And, to those who might be so concerned:  of the 34 kids that I know (in same-sex homes), 4 are Gay and 2 are lesbians.  That seems to fit within the accepted percentages.  The argument that Gays are mentally disordered is too specious for words.  In the developed world, there is neither a legitimate Medical nor Psychiatric association that would agree with that claim.  The statement from T. Hansen about [t]he accumulated wisdom of 5000 years is germane to nothing.  The social, legal and/or religious definitions of and practices of marriage have varied widely over time.  Each society, each generation has defined the concept of marriage to fit its own needs.  The slippery slope arguments is one of the oldest chestnuts to cause confusion and install fear and doubt.  The cited outcomes of same-sex marriage border on preposterous and inflammatory.  No reasonable person could possibly follow the inane blathering.  Finally, going back to the earliest extant Hebrew Torah, I am absolutely unable to find any text in which God says to Adam and Eve, Okay, first you guys get married and then you be fruitful and multiply.  Okay? Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage\n"

      "157arg7 There should not be an argument over whether or not gay marriage should be legal. Whether you are gay, straight, lesbian, bisexual, transexual, or anything else, you are a human being. According to the United States Declaration of Independence, all men are created equal and citizens of the United States are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. If all are created equal, then everyone should have the right to marry who they love. Marriage is part of the pursuit of happiness for many people, and if a gay person wants to get married, they should be able to. There are no legal reasons why two homosexual people should not be allowed to marry, only religious ones (that I know of: if I'm wrong, please tell me! I actually want to know!) and there is supposed to be a separation of church and state in our country. *I know that the Declaration quote is overused x1000, but it's 100% true. Marriage should be between a man and a woman\n"

      "160arg7 This same sex marriage term is destroying the true MEANING of marriage. Did you guys know that gay couples are actually prone to get more diseases than non-gay couples..?...so just take a chance and look at the future after 20 years, the population of this world will soon decrease. SO...WHY destroy the meaning of marriage when you guys know that it WILL lead into disaster later on in the future. And even IF you're born gay...I would definitely encourage you (with all due respect) to use your brains and   take pills to decrease or increase your no. of hormones. Being gay can seriously destroy the whole concept and the TRUE meaning of marriage. Can you produce your OWN biological babies on your own if youre married with the same sex person?..OF course you CAN'T!.. and even if you adopted a kid...well you should understand and consider how she/he would feel, having gay parents. So please, with all due respect...see the future before you make any progress now..before it's too late. Marriage should be between a man and a woman\n"

      "164arg1 Well'if we start legalizing gay marriage,that would be one step forward to integrating them into mainstream society.It would lead to less discrimination against them and to view them as natural. Well, that is exactly what would be wrong with this.  We tell our children that it is right to be gay,that most certainly shatters the pillars of society anywhere and everywhere.And let us also consider the repercussions-I live in India,where there was little to no of this stuff until a few years ago.Now, thanks to the pretentious tolerance that the west is showing,gay culture is booming out here as well.  Yet it does not have as much momentum as in the west,simply because of social stigma (which is essential,and extremely low divorce rates are a proof). It may not be anyone's business who a man sleeps with in the privacy of his home,but viewing it as natural or normal will destroy how we view ourselves in context to others.Next time a child goes to his locker room,you cannot be sure what he is going to face or feel.  10 year olds having a sleepover can perceive this as normal,then there is no telling where we can end up. Change for the sake of change is unnecessary and dangerous... Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage\n"

      "167arg5 Whether one is homosexual or heterosexual is not due to any learned response.  Both homosexuals and heterosexuals are what they are because nature made them so.  All persons should be treated as human beings. No person should be oppressed simply because that person is different or thinks differently than another person.  The real reason that some people want the14th Amendment repealed, is because treating people equally doesn't fit, Their  Freedom of Religion.  All humans, whether believers or non-believers, deserve the same treatment.  Churches that recognize homosexual marriage are excersing their Freedom of Religion just as much as Churches that do not recognize homosexual marriage.  The U.

Some of these Constitutions say this expressly, and some imply it through Construction and implication, which is a necessary and proper way to interpret all of those Constitutions.

You are actually going to hide behind religion. Last time I checked marriage was for people who are in love not just between a man and woman. Why should a LESBIAN be miserable in a marriage just because they cant get married to the one they love. You people are promoting cheating and crumbling marriage. All you want to do is discriminate against the gays because we are what you call HAPPY, :D we love people for what is in the inside and not just what they have on the outside.  As for your infomation im happy ENGAGED to my girlfriend and we are getting married rather you close minded people like it or not. By the way, one day you guys will loose and it will be legal in the U.S. I mean its legal for gays to be in the military whats stopping the states from legalizing it. Personally not everybody believes in the Bible or any religion. So why deny people marriage just because a selected few think its immoral.

It doesn't affect anyone at all! All it does is make two people of the same sex happy. We are fighting to get this right to marry who we wish! Straight people take this freedom for granted, and have a high divorce rate! So, if they can be happy, why can't we be? I want to marry my fiance, but my state won't allow me to. This is not fair to me and my fiance at all! Marriage and gay marriage are the same thing! The only difference is that marriage is for a man and a woman, and gay marriage is for two men or two women. That is the only difference! People need to get over their homophobia, Bible thumping ways of thinking and allow us this happiness!

Because the bible condemns homosexuality as an immoral and unnatural sin. and marriage is a religious thing Even though homosexuality MIGHT be a sin, it's not greater than any other sin. My point is, in the bible it also says having sex before marriage is a sin and lying is a sin.. how come they haven't put a law on those sins?

      "182arg3 i believe gays should get married because of spousal rights, equality, and religion. Gays should get married because marriage confers many rights, protections, and benefits. (legal and practical) such as tax benefits, estate planning benefits, government benefits, family benefits, employment benefits, medical benefits, death benefits, family benefits, etc. Gays should get married because of equality. Gays should be treated equally. I  feel as though if you're against gay marriage you shouldn't marry your heterosexual partner. One reason people may oppose gay marriage is for religious reasons. Because the bible condemns homosexuality as an immoral and unnatural sin. and marriage is a religious thing Even though homosexuality MIGHT be a sin, it's not greater than any other sin. My point is, in the bible it also says having sex before marriage is a sin and lying is a sin.. how come they haven't put a law on those sins?  God loves everyone, if god really thought homosexuality was sin why did he create them? I strongly am for gay marriage Gay marriage undermines the institution of marriage, leading to an increase in out of wedlock births and divorce rates\n"
