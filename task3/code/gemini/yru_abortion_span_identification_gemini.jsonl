{"id": "ab112arg13", "span": "Abortion is not murder. I never forgot that. I was attacking the argument from sapience not debating weather it is ethical to deny the existence of a hypothetical being. your commentary isn't relative to what i posted.   it is ethical to deny someone's or rather some human being's existence before they exist. It is ok to wear a condom. any such person being stopped from existing is just hypothetical. A fetus isnt a person, it is a human being. however just what the hell is a person? abortion gets down to questions that have been disputed for hundreds of years, and to this day don't possess satisfactory answers.   A fetus is undeniably alive by the way, it just doesn't demonstrate sapience and can not. Expanding the scope of the argument leads to problems, showing that the argument from sapience is only valid with \"but\", \"ifs\" etc which would contradict the argument. Is a baby born less then one day ago really sapient? if not, why not be able to put it in a dumpster. It does not have a choice of its own, and does not seem very \"person\" like. Thus it fits the criteria and people should have the ability to kill it, for it is very dependent on a care taker(s) and what right does it have to impose on anyone? This is just one of many examples."}

I don't know where you get your definition   Oh I don't know, I just went to dictionary.com and got this definition and it doesn't discriminate on the basis of level of dependency like you do. What you call \"potential\" it calls life. In fact it makes no such distinction. Something is either alive or not. Also, I couldn't find a definition for potential life, only an article referring to it as a \"a clever rhetorical trick\" And since the parents of this life are human It's safe to say it's human. That ought to be obvious to any casual observer. Here is the standard definition of life;   the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms, being manifested by growth through metabolism, reproduction, and the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally.     we don't actually need to ban abortion cos doing that doesn't actually help   Banning abortion wouldn't stop the killing of over 1500 humans a day?

{"span": "The government recognizes the risks of the woman and awards here the right to decide."}
{"span": "You said, â€œTell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.â€?  It takes two, the woman canâ€™t conceive on her own and no man can produce a child on his own. But that has nothing to do with responsibility. Our government even though it recognizes the father if they are marriedâ€¦does not take him into consideration, should she want to abort. He simply is not an issue. The government recognizes the risks of the woman and awards here the right to decide.     If they are both are responsible for the risks they takeâ€¦then why are the fathers rights stripped?  You said, â€œAnswer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.â€?  Yes he does. Yes he does. Yes he does. BUT, he also knows he can walk away if he doesnâ€™t want to be involved. Exampleâ€¦..  Two kids having sex on the beach during spring break. They want to have sex obviously for pleasure. They might not even know their names or where they are from. Now who takes the big risk should they get pregnant? The guy or the gal. Who can fade into the sunset, never to be seen or heard from again? THE MAN She takes the big risk. What risk did the kid take? NONE. This Cassie Anthony trialâ€¦..she says she has no idea who the father of Caylee was. She was known for sleeping around and they did DNA samples on many of her acquaintances. Nothing turned up. They even did DNA on her father and brother. Who got pregnant, who had the baby? She didâ€¦because whether reckless sex happened or notâ€¦the risk she took didnâ€™t pan outâ€¦.she got pregnantâ€¦.and where is the dad???????  You said, â€œIf the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on all grounds. Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by law then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?â€?  Well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds. In this case I believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it, it would go to him.   You said, â€œHere's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?â€?   Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.

You are a joke  Youâ€™re so ridiculous itâ€™s not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings â€œ  You also said, â€œYou deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps you re-read that section because here is what I said   I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.  I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.â€?  And you want to compare your use of the noun Pigâ€¦to the descriptions I have used? Do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective? You gotta come up with something better than this. LOL   A pig is a filthy animal that lives in a styâ€¦â€¦â€¦LMAO   How old are you really, are you even an adult? What I stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible.   And why are you bringing religion into this. All these humanists bringing religion into debatesâ€¦when I have not. Is it because of my name? Again ignoranceâ€¦go research what a churchmouse is. Do you think that Christians because of the love commandment should just take itâ€¦roll over and play dead? Why do you judge me by perfect standards and not yourself. You have a filthy mouth and it demeans your postsâ€¦and makes you look like you have no class. You use the F bomb like itâ€™s a conjunction. Your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror Hitler and Sangers and I could add a few more for that matterâ€¦..but will leave it with these two. Why donâ€™t you do some heavy research on thisâ€¦not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? Your position is heartless, cold, and you like I said are ignorant of the facts. Your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life.  I said, â€œYou said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ€¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.  You said, I know and your point is?â€?  And this is not championing abortion? LMAO And you want people to believe your pro-life? LMAO  I said this, â€œIt got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man Then you replied with this. â€œThis is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They both decide to have sex, they both know the risks, they both procreate. They are both responsible.â€?  Why? is biology sexist? The truth is the truth it seeks no sides. We have hashed this over and over and you will never get it Iâ€™m afraid. The man does not have to assume squatâ€¦unless he is married and the courts order him to pay. Did the kid on the beach have to do anything? How many one night stands you think happen when the male just takes offâ€¦knowing or not knowing if he impregnated the woman?  You said, â€œAn unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.'  Not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. Bugger? Boy have not heard that one since Kindergarten.  You said, â€œThe man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.â€?  Only because she says YES. He goes on her invite. If they are running around the basesâ€¦have not scored a grand slamâ€¦ and she says noâ€¦â€¦..itâ€™s no, you canâ€™t come in. If he does against her wishes itâ€™s rape. Instigating has nothing to do with this. But whose body is changed by the sex act? Not his..Hers. She knows that what he might leave behind will affect her for at least nine months. He knows that it wonâ€™t affect him in the leastâ€¦..UNLESS HE IS MARRIED.     â€œHow, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers do have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.â€?  It does take a man and a woman to procreateâ€¦which is why I also am against same sex unions, itâ€™s not naturalâ€¦but thatâ€™s another debate. They both have sexâ€¦.blah blahâ€¦â€¦..and as I said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. SO WHO TAKES THE BIG RISK?  Sure some married couples are on the same pageâ€¦.but we will never know how many married women go behind their spouses backs to kill, because they know their husband would not approve. There is no way of knowing that statistic.  You said, â€œSeriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.  Not true. I state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. You champion killing so you donâ€™t want to see the evidence. You want the killing option open which in my opinion is cold.  You said, â€œI'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.â€?  Why on earth would you of all people be sorry? Mind boggling to say the least. I am not a hypocrite, I simply made a mistake lived in hell and want to share my story. My kind of story is the one PP does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way.     Tell meâ€¦â€¦Have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? Did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didnâ€™t believe that way all along? Are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? What?...we canâ€™t change our minds about issues, feelings? Must be nice to be perfect. Well my position on abortion changedâ€¦.and I am allowed to change my mindâ€¦..are you?   When you make a huge mistakeâ€¦.if you have children donâ€™t you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them? What youâ€™re saying hereâ€¦.is that I do not have the right to change my mind, I donâ€™t have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? You are the one who is judgemental and arrogantâ€¦.. but then youâ€™re perfect remember?   â€œIn a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.â€?  Oh my goodness donâ€™t. I was not a child when I had itâ€¦.I should have known betterâ€¦and I took the risk because I knew what would happen. But like most others in the heat of passion I guess I didnâ€™t care and did it anyway. No one thrusted anything on me, and guess what, I do not blame anyone but myself. I am a wonderful person MOST of the time, not perfect like you but I am ok. I have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the SAME MANâ€¦.and have a blessed life. Christ forgave me when I became His. And I promised Him that abortion would be my witnessâ€¦to share what HE did for me in my hour of need. I am the luckiest person in the world. The baby I aborted was my husbands. A pregnancy at that time would have been hard. We were on the same pageâ€¦until laterâ€¦when I started suffering, he could not understand my feelings. He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different, because when I became Christs, he didnâ€™t. Worldviews changeâ€¦.and mine did drastically. We have adjustedâ€¦and he now tolerates my feelings, actions. I do not force my beliefs on him. I pray someday we will be on the same page.     You said, â€œI have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?â€?  Distraught about what? Tell meâ€¦.how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala tripâ€¦.then go against what your morals tell you is wrong? I donâ€™t get it. Abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. Have you ever seen one? Anyone who does not see one and think itâ€™s horrendousâ€¦is cold, compassionless and EMPTY.   Here watch thisâ€¦â€¦..and if you donâ€™t, think about the reasons why you wonâ€™t. Search your heartâ€¦about why you would support something so barbaric. And if you have childrenâ€¦.put them in the place of the tiny one who is getting slaughtered.      http://www.catholic.org/video/?v=13       I am not Catholic but they always have good stuff on their sites about abortion.     â€œI'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.â€?  What is upsetting about it? And who says the kids are young? I wouldnâ€™t tell a child about abortion for all the obvious reasons. I would at least wait until the child was the age when a lot of kids are having sex. I told my kids when they were teenagers. Itâ€™s not selfishâ€¦its real life and it happens. Kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. What makes abortion different you tell me? Itâ€™s the most performed surgery in the world.     I said, â€œYou are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ€¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill  You said, â€œNot pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.â€?  You are pro-abortion period, end of story. You want to deceive yourself into thinking youâ€™re not but you are. You condone what that video I wanted you to watchâ€¦shows. Thatâ€™s what you think should be legal. You do not stand up for all life.  â€œWhat has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.â€?  Well there were people back then who stood by and did nothingâ€¦.and looked the other way. In a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. Everyone participatedâ€¦â€¦good should have overcome evil, but didnâ€™t. People act out of fearâ€¦.and I am sure there were people who did not like what Hitler was doing BUT DIDNâ€™T DO ANYTHING TO STOP HIMâ€¦I am talking about the people in his own countryâ€¦.the people who could have physically taken himoutâ€¦.the guards, etc.   Abortion is like thatâ€¦.people sit by and do nothingâ€¦.they think anything they doâ€¦.wonâ€™t change the laws, wonâ€™t help the victim. But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortionâ€¦.if every parent with compassion in his heart would stand up for what is right and goodâ€¦â€¦.abortion would once again be considered murder. If we stood up as a nation about the evils of abortionâ€¦.wowâ€¦.how many lives would be changed, hearts mended. But we are a secular country that has turned its face from Godâ€¦and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws. I work with people who are atheistsâ€¦.so it is possible for people with no faith at all to stand up and make a difference. Its knowing what is right and wrong, what is good and evilâ€¦â€¦â€¦..standing up for it, no matter what.  You said, â€œAgain what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.â€?  Again talking about standing up for what is right, doing the right thingâ€¦â€¦..even if you are swimming up stream. I know the odds are against abortion being overturned are slim to noneâ€¦â€¦but I keep working and praying I am wrong. Society is sinking into a moral less abyss.  You said, â€œI sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.â€?  You condone murderâ€¦.I never called you a racist.     You said, â€œI don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?â€?  I never use violent adjectives on youâ€¦.you used a noun to describe me. And swearing is classlessâ€¦  .  â€œI didn't say pain is the only reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it was true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.â€?  Well you hold the cards to your future eternity. No one else is responsible but you. And if youâ€™re wrongâ€¦you will have all eternity to think about it. How do you know EVERYONE has been condemned? And how do you know that you will be recognizable in hell to your family and friends? If you went to hell with themâ€¦..being with family etcâ€¦would be just a tad bit goodâ€¦you would have support, be near the ones you love. And if you have support, then it is not hell. LOL What happens if you get there and you canâ€™t find anyone? Well you would have all eternity thrashing about to find them I suppose.   I know many people in my family who will not goâ€¦that is their choice. I bothers me, and I cry about it sometimes when I am praying. But I love Christ more than any other person in the worldâ€¦.and I have faith in Himâ€¦.more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it. Heaven is perfectâ€¦.and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved.  â€œYou name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning again if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?â€?  Itâ€™s funny all the nonreligious, materialists, humanists, atheists, agnostics always bring up religion, must be they think about it a lot. LOL I do not feel I called you names. I described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with. I am certainly not trying to get revenge, come on. I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I am bold, and I do state the facts in ways people feel offended. But I think down inside they are offended because what I say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. And you think abortion is ok. Andâ€¦.you are judging meâ€¦I point out what you say that are untruths but I am not judging your heartâ€¦.I canâ€™t, scripture does not allow me to do thatâ€¦not unless you claim to be a Christian. That is why I bring no scriptures up with you because you donâ€™t know better. God will judge you. I can however judge actions (not hearts) of Christians as they can judge mine and many have done thatâ€¦I thank them for it because many times more than I would like to admit, I needed judgement. Why do you quote a book you donâ€™t believe in? LOL  You said, â€œNo I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.â€?  You donâ€™t believe in it, yet you use it to make a point. LOL     You said, â€œI said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.â€?  You are a pro-abort and you champion abortion periodâ€¦.live with it accept the label take it as your own.  You said, â€œWhy because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is my words. You ask for evidence you get it.â€?  LOL Boy you are really diggin deep nowâ€¦. I post rarely from Wikipediaâ€¦.and on this forum have posted from very reliable sources. I am not however handing my posts in to be gradedâ€¦.so I could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation. I workâ€¦.I live a full life and when I get on hereâ€¦.I slam it out the fastest way I can. If I had to hand in an article or paper â€¦.it would be correct.     You have provided however little evidence, more lies. Just like the lie about the earliest born preemieâ€¦.I showed you your error. I work in this field and I knowâ€¦.  â€œI don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.câ€?  This is your worldviewâ€¦and explains what I said all alongâ€¦why you are pro-abortion. The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. I feel sorry for you actually.     You said, â€œWhat do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?â€?  Who is setting abortion clinics on fire? If you compare the acts of violence against how many abortion clinics there are in the worldâ€¦â€¦its nothing. Pro-lifers are basically kind and compassionate people who respect the lawâ€¦just try to change it. Am I preaching? What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing? Do you ever look in a mirror?   You simply act like a juvenile. You have no class... You do not even know what you are saying.   LOL  You said two things in your postâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeksâ€¦.and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. LOL   Canâ€™t let this one goâ€¦â€¦your hilarious. I mean that in the nicest comedic way possible. LOL     This is what you said earlierâ€¦ You said, â€œI said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.â€?  So is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel painâ€¦.or 24 weeks when obviously it canâ€™t. LOL  You do not even know your own position. That is why you look silly and have to swear.   Do you even know when the fetus can feel pain? LOL Nawâ€¦you donâ€™t.,"}

But that has nothing to do with responsibility. Our government even though it recognizes the father if they are marriedâ€¦does not take him into consideration, should she want to abort. He simply is not an issue. The government recognizes the risks of the woman and awards here the right to decide.     If they are both are responsible for the risks they takeâ€¦then why are the fathers rights stripped?  You said, â€œAnswer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.â€?  Yes he does. Yes he does. Yes he does. BUT, he also knows he can walk away if he doesnâ€™t want to be involved. Exampleâ€¦..  Two kids having sex on the beach during spring break. They want to have sex obviously for pleasure. They might not even know their names or where they are from. Now who takes the big risk should they get pregnant? The guy or the gal. Who can fade into the sunset, never to be seen or heard from again? THE MAN She takes the big risk. What risk did the kid take? NONE. This Cassie Anthony trialâ€¦..she says she has no idea who the father of Caylee was. She was known for sleeping around and they did DNA samples on many of her acquaintances. Nothing turned up. They even did DNA on her father and brother. Who got pregnant, who had the baby? She didâ€¦because whether reckless sex happened or notâ€¦the risk she took didnâ€™t pan outâ€¦.she got pregnantâ€¦.and where is the dad???????  You said, â€œIf the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on all grounds.

How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.â€?  Why on earth would you of all people be sorry? Mind boggling to say the least. I am not a hypocrite, I simply made a mistake lived in hell and want to share my story. My kind of story is the one PP does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way.     Tell meâ€¦â€¦Have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? Did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didnâ€™t believe that way all along? Are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? What?...we canâ€™t change our minds about issues, feelings? Must be nice to be perfect. Well my position on abortion changedâ€¦.and I am allowed to change my mindâ€¦..are you?   When you make a huge mistakeâ€¦.if you have children donâ€™t you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them? What youâ€™re saying hereâ€¦.is that I do not have the right to change my mind, I donâ€™t have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? You are the one who is judgemental and arrogantâ€¦.. but then youâ€™re perfect remember?   â€œIn a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.â€?  Oh my goodness donâ€™t. I was not a child when I had itâ€¦.I should have known betterâ€¦and I took the risk because I knew what would happen. But like most others in the heat of passion I guess I didnâ€™t care and did it anyway. No one thrusted anything on me, and guess what, I do not blame anyone but myself. I am a wonderful person MOST of the time, not perfect like you but I am ok. I have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the SAME MANâ€¦.and have a blessed life. Christ forgave me when I became His. And I promised Him that abortion would be my witnessâ€¦to share what HE did for me in my hour of need. I am the luckiest person in the world. The baby I aborted was my husbands. A pregnancy at that time would have been hard. We were on the same pageâ€¦until laterâ€¦when I started suffering, he could not understand my feelings. He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different, because when I became Christs, he didnâ€™t. Worldviews changeâ€¦.and mine did drastically. We have adjustedâ€¦and he now tolerates my feelings, actions. I do not force my beliefs on him. I pray someday we will be on the same page.     You said, â€œI have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?â€?  Distraught about what? Tell meâ€¦.how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala tripâ€¦.then go against what your morals tell you is wrong? I donâ€™t get it. Abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. Have you ever seen one? Anyone who does not see one and think itâ€™s horrendousâ€¦is cold, compassionless and EMPTY.   Here watch thisâ€¦â€¦..and if you donâ€™t, think about the reasons why you wonâ€™t. Search your heartâ€¦about why you would support something so barbaric. And if you have childrenâ€¦.put them in the place of the tiny one who is getting slaughtered.      http://www.catholic.org/video/?v=13       I am not Catholic but they always have good stuff on their sites about abortion.     â€œI'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.â€?  What is upsetting about it? And who says the kids are young? I wouldnâ€™t tell a child about abortion for all the obvious reasons. I would at least wait until the child was the age when a lot of kids are having sex. I told my kids when they were teenagers. Itâ€™s not selfishâ€¦its real life and it happens. Kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. What makes abortion different you tell me? Itâ€™s the most performed surgery in the world.     I said, â€œYou are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ€¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill  You said, â€œNot pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.â€?  You are pro-abortion period, end of story. You want to deceive yourself into thinking youâ€™re not but you are. You condone what that video I wanted you to watchâ€¦shows. Thatâ€™s what you think should be legal. You do not stand up for all life.  â€œWhat has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.â€?  Well there were people back then who stood by and did nothingâ€¦.and looked the other way. In a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. Everyone participatedâ€¦â€¦good should have overcome evil, but didnâ€™t. People act out of fearâ€¦.and I am sure there were people who did not like what Hitler was doing BUT DIDNâ€™T DO ANYTHING TO STOP HIMâ€¦I am talking about the people in his own countryâ€¦.the people who could have physically taken himoutâ€¦.the guards, etc.   Abortion is like thatâ€¦.people sit by and do nothingâ€¦.they think anything they doâ€¦.wonâ€™t change the laws, wonâ€™t help the victim. But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortionâ€¦.if every parent with compassion in his heart would stand up for what is right and goodâ€¦â€¦.abortion would once again be considered murder. If we stood up as a nation about the evils of abortionâ€¦.wowâ€¦.how many lives would be changed, hearts mended. But we are a secular country that has turned its face from Godâ€¦and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws. I work with people who are atheistsâ€¦.so it is possible for people with no faith at all to stand up and make a difference. Its knowing what is right and wrong, what is good and evilâ€¦â€¦â€¦..standing up for it, no matter what.  You said, â€œAgain what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.â€?  Again talking about standing up for what is right, doing the right thingâ€¦â€¦..even if you are swimming up stream. I know the odds are against abortion being overturned are slim to noneâ€¦â€¦but I keep working and praying I am wrong. Society is sinking into a moral less abyss.  You said, â€œI sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.â€?  You condone murderâ€¦.I never called you a racist.     You said, â€œI don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?â€?  I never use violent adjectives on youâ€¦.you used a noun to describe me. And swearing is classlessâ€¦  .  â€œI didn't say pain is the only reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it was true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.â€?  Well you hold the cards to your future eternity. No one else is responsible but you. And if youâ€™re wrongâ€¦you will have all eternity to think about it. How do you know EVERYONE has been condemned? And how do you know that you will be recognizable in hell to your family and friends? If you went to hell with themâ€¦..being with family etcâ€¦would be just a tad bit goodâ€¦you would have support, be near the ones you love. And if you have support, then it is not hell. LOL What happens if you get there and you canâ€™t find anyone? Well you would have all eternity thrashing about to find them I suppose.   I know many people in my family who will not goâ€¦that is their choice. I bothers me, and I cry about it sometimes when I am praying. But I love Christ more than any other person in the worldâ€¦.and I have faith in Himâ€¦.more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it. Heaven is perfectâ€¦.and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved.  â€œYou name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning again if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?â€?  Itâ€™s funny all the nonreligious, materialists, humanists, atheists, agnostics always bring up religion, must be they think about it a lot. LOL I do not feel I called you names. I described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with. I am certainly not trying to get revenge, come on. I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I am bold, and I do state the facts in ways people feel offended. But I think down inside they are offended because what I say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. And you think abortion is ok. Andâ€¦.you are judging meâ€¦I point out what you say that are untruths but I am not judging your heartâ€¦.I canâ€™t, scripture does not allow me to do thatâ€¦not unless you claim to be a Christian. That is why I bring no scriptures up with you because you donâ€™t know better. God will judge you. I can however judge actions (not hearts) of Christians as they can judge mine and many have done thatâ€¦I thank them for it because many times more than I would like to admit, I needed judgement. Why do you quote a book you donâ€™t believe in? LOL  You said, â€œNo I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.â€?  You donâ€™t believe in it, yet you use it to make a point. LOL     You said, â€œI said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.â€?  You are a pro-abort and you champion abortion periodâ€¦.live with it accept the label take it as your own.  You said, â€œWhy because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is my words. You ask for evidence you get it.â€?  LOL Boy you are really diggin deep nowâ€¦. I post rarely from Wikipediaâ€¦.and on this forum have posted from very reliable sources. I am not however handing my posts in to be gradedâ€¦.so I could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation. I workâ€¦.I live a full life and when I get on hereâ€¦.I slam it out the fastest way I can. If I had to hand in an article or paper â€¦.it would be correct.     You have provided however little evidence, more lies. Just like the lie about the earliest born preemieâ€¦.I showed you your error. I work in this field and I knowâ€¦.  â€œI don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.câ€?  This is your worldviewâ€¦and explains what I said all alongâ€¦why you are pro-abortion. The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. I feel sorry for you actually.     You said, â€œWhat do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?â€?  Who is setting abortion clinics on fire? If you compare the acts of violence against how many abortion clinics there are in the worldâ€¦â€¦its nothing. Pro-lifers are basically kind and compassionate people who respect the lawâ€¦just try to change it. Am I preaching? What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing? Do you ever look in a mirror?   You simply act like a juvenile. You have no class... You do not even know what you are saying.   LOL  You said two things in your postâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeksâ€¦.and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. LOL   Canâ€™t let this one goâ€¦â€¦your hilarious. I mean that in the nicest comedic way possible. LOL     This is what you said earlierâ€¦ You said, â€œI said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.â€?  So is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel painâ€¦.or 24 weeks when obviously it canâ€™t. LOL  You do not even know your own position. That is why you look silly and have to swear.   Do you even know when the fetus can feel pain? LOL Nawâ€¦you donâ€™t.,"}

We start bartering and haggling. When does a human get rights, what rights, which humans should get them etc etc. But if we conclude with this option, then there is no real reason to limit ourselves to the unborn - Nazi Germany is a very modern example of a nation haggling with these inalienable rights on born human beings.  So first of all, we need to see what implications rise from the views and ideas to which we have attached ourselves to.  Now that you've thought about these implications, lets look at abortion from an honest perspective - it's the termination of the life of a developing human being for the sake of perserving the convenience and the satisfaction of another person. This is against all reason. Convenience does not justify the termination of another human's life - murder.  The parents are generally always responsible for the creation of the fetus, so they should have the moral obligation to support the life of that fetus. If they do not want the child, they can give him/her up for adoption - adoption is not some myth. We must also strive for the creation of institutions that would take care of unwanted children in a loving, productive environment. Murder is not an acceptable alternative for a civilized nation.  Given the fact that pregnancy lasts 9 months, one needs to ask themselves - Is murder justified by temporary inconvenience?  For the sake of comparison, think of the USA, 1800 - the question of slavery. Some of you may object, but the general rethoric at the time was completely the same - Blacks are not fully human, thus they have no rights ; We should not force our opinions on other people, lets respect our freedom to choose ; We are not ready for such an extensive protection of human rights, we need to go step by step etc etc.   Nowaydays we laugh and ridicule such arguments as we see it self-evidently that slavery is immoral and I'm convinced that 100 years from now, we'll be seeing abortion in the same light.  As abortion does not affirm to my vision of what an ethical, civilized nation should be like - I'm forced to subscribe to the pro-life position."}

You look silly. Our laws say that the baby is not his enough to be a part of the decision...he has no choice in the matter. Why men don't see this and storm in outrage I don't know. Who is the one that gets pregnant? Can the man get pregnant? Who takes the risk? Either you are so young that you don't know better....or I just don't know, your ignorant about what responsiblity is.   You are cold. But then you respresent death to innocent human beings because you are a pro-abort. You champion killing. And that is what abortion is...whether its in the first month...or ninth, its killing. The abortionists goal isnt to shoot a documentary, or catch a fish, or play a round of golf.......it is to KILL THAT WHICH IS IN THE WOMANS WOMB. It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man.  You're a typical pro-abort all over the place, not consistent at all. Sigh  If a child is gonna make her life awful...kill it. LMAO So compassionate of you.   catticus....is there something wrong with abortion or not? You personally believe...but you still condone....yes, but no....but maybe...  You gave devormity and imperfection as a valid reason for aborting. You personally wouldnt abort on these grounds.........well my dear what grounds would you kill?   I bring up Hitler because Margaret Sanger...influenced him and she was the founder of Planned Parenthood. Your views on this mirror theirs...because they acted them out. Do some research and you will see. Google...Sanger and Hitler...then see if you agree with them. If you don't I would like to know what you disagree with them on.   You call me a pig and then tell me I am mean for comparing your views to Hitler? Come on........LOL  Do you also support the women who are afraid and kill their born children...Do you also defend people who murder, rape, steal?........hell......you make excuses for everything. You are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn.  You are saying death should always be an option. How do you go to bat for the innocent in the womb? You don't.  You think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks, it was the wrong sex .....but its ok, if its deformed. Do you ever read what you post here and really really think about what you say and how it sounds. YOU YOU YOU....think   What do YOU think any aborted child in the womb would say if they could talk (hell infant babies cant talk either) and address the one who killed them, the one who presumed they would have a horrible life?   You said you would not deny a woman the right to kill, therefore you are pro-abortion, because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed. You are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car...and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing. LOL  You pro-aborts kill me....no pun intended.  What does pain have to do with anything? The point I was trying to make was...that you are probably pro-abortion UNTIL.......the time you think the fetus can feel pain. And geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we? I mean that would be inhumane right? You are a joke.  You say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason...(the man is not an issue unless money is involved) but that it shouldnt be her responsiblity only........(what the man should pay for the killing?) you think when the baby can feel pain abortion should not be allowed.... not allowed...after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable.  I know the studies...I know people who have done the studies. The fact is....that which is in the womb is human, is alive and is a growing person. Science is on the side of life and defines it in terms that are not pro-choice. Life was not concieved to kill in this way, it is unfortunate that you and others do not put any worth in the womb.,"}

Yes, the fact is that a fetus, after a certain point, is a human being. It has a consciousness. Before that certain point, it has no consciousness."}
{"span": "No, I see abortion as acceptable up until a certain point and evil after another point."}
{"span": "No, I see abortion as acceptable up until a certain point and evil after another point. You forgot to listen to me again. The gray area is that the overall event of abortion can be good or evil, either black or white, therefore it in itself is gray if you look at it in it's entirety.  Cultures that think it is acceptable to invariably harm the existence of an innocent human being are either going to collapse because they're psychopathic, or they're going to collapse because they are overall brainwashed into not believing that the act of rape doesn't invariably harm a human being. Stop acting like there are tons of cultures that think murder and torture and rape are right, because there aren't. Cannibalism isn't common because only psychopaths and stone age cultures commonly practice it. The same goes for rape and murder. You think murder is acceptable in a place like China or Kuwait because they have different cultures then us? It isn't. Because culture does not bypass morality. The human mind does.  Evil, in a way, is in the eye of the beholder. But harm is not. If you negatively effect the existence of a human being, you are harming it. Whether you think you are harming them or not does not change the fact that you harm them. The ability to attempt perceive this is programmed into our brains through morality. What you need to understand is that harm is infallible. It doesn't matter if Hitler's Nazis thought they were murdering evil Jewish people, because they were, in truth, harming the existence of the human race by deriving it of millions of people. Just because a group of Christians beat a person with turrets to death because they think he's possessed doesn't mean they didn't harm the existence of that human being, disabled or not. Harm is not subjective. It is a state of existence beyond the ability to perceive.   It's radical to say something is totally wrong when many things are not totally wrong depending on the circumstance.  Stop calling you names? No. You look foolish for obviously being close-minded and not even being able to understand anything I'm saying.   My example is NOT sick, you are just a neophyte with no imagination! You think it's wrong, no matter the circumstance, for a perfectly sane and conscious adult to have sex with a perfectly sane, conscious, AND consenting teenager? I said teenager, not child, and there's a difference. Does your morality really only go so far as the law does? What's the difference between a consenting adult and 17 year old having sex and a consenting adult and an 18 year old having sex? The difference is that the law says one is abhorrently wrong... which is, in fact, bullshit. Having sex with someone extremely young is wrong because the child is not consenting and/or under agreement and/or understanding the circumstance in the first place. A teenager at a certain age has the capacity for all of the same things an adult has, including love, judgment, knowledge, awareness, coordination, everything. And if the teenager is a little young and  doesn't  have have all these things, they have almost all of these things. Who are you to dictate that love is wrong based on law or order? Consenting, mutual love is beautiful and chaotic and knows no boundaries. Which brings me to a question for you... if a 90 year old and 60 year old fall in love, is that wrong? There's a 30 year difference, as where a 14 year old and 18 year old have only a 4 year difference. It's illegal for that 18 and 14 year old to fall in love and exercise their love, so why shouldn't the love between a 90 and 60 year old be illegal to exercise physically? Do you not see the whole in that logic? A consenting, understanding person is a consenting, understanding person regardless of age. Children are never consenting and understanding people in regards with sex. Some underage teenagers, on the other hand,  are , by mathematical probability. Mutual, understanding, consenting love shouldn't be restricted by the law, and if you have any compassion, you'll have an imagination and agree with me.  Facts I know about abortion? Facts about abortion are that the fetus does not have brain waves, and therefore a consciousness, until a certain stage in the pregnancy. That's a fact. Duh. I've said that about a dozen times to you. It's funny how you've showed your obliviousness to everything I've been saying by asking for the facts I've been repeating to you over and over again.  Yes, the fact is that a fetus, after a certain point, is a human being. It has a consciousness. Before that certain point, it has no consciousness. Now, I'm going to ask this next question with my caps lock and italics on:  WHAT IS YOUR PROOF THAT A FETUS IS A HUMAN BEING BEFORE IT HAS A CONSCIOUSNESS?  I agree that a fetus with a consciousness is a human being. You think that it's always a human being, period. Give me proof that it is a human being, period, regardless of having a consciousness or not.  I'm not 'pro-abortion'. I have said this multiple times and my ideas are not 'pro-abortion'. Stop saying that I'm 'pro-abortion' before I decide to call you a dumb twat, you oblivious nincompoop.   Yup, I'm God. Everything is God. You're God to, you know.  No, it is a fact that under certain circumstances, sex with a teenager does not harm the teenager or adult, therefore it is not wrong. If it doesn't harm them, how is it wrong?  Cheating can be wrong because it harms the emotions of your spouse or mate, depending on their mentality. Some people don't mind open relationships because they aren't emotionally damaged by cheating. Therefore, for them, cheating is not wrong.  The same applies to lying and stealing. Example for lying: You're a Jew living in Germany. It's 1938. You look a little more German then Jewish. Nazis ask you if you and your family are Jewish. You lie and say you're not Jewish. You save your family and yourself. If you think that lie was wrong, you are a naive, brainwashed fool. Have an imagination that factors in circumstance.  Example of stealing: you're poor and starving. So is your family. A rich man leaves his car unlocked. His wallet with 1000 dollars is in the unlocked car. You steal the money and leave the wallet. You stop your family and you from starving to death long enough to get a job. If you think stealing in that case was wrong, then you apparently are so brainwashed as to not believe in the morality of  Robin Hood .  Child abuse is never wrong, because it's abuse. Abuse is to harm someone for no reason. Harm is infallible. Child abuse is never right.  I do not defend evil. I defend only good. You are just a humongous idiot. In fact, YOU defend evil if you think that the Jew in 1938 shouldn't have lied, if you think the stealing man shouldn't have feed his family, and if the 18 year old with a 14 year old lover should go to jail for the rest of your life.   Do you support these things? I hope you say no.  In the case that you say yes, you are an evil piece of shit. You believe in harming people just because the law tells you to harm people. In which case, you deserve the Hell of the black and white Christianity you so believe in.  But, I don't even think YOU are brainwashed enough to say 'yes'. I'm glad you won't.  You failed to understand what I said, AGAIN. Fool. People who are unconscious still have a consciousness. When you sleep, your brain is a billion times more active then when you're awake. The same goes for comas. They have a consciousness, and therefore we KNOW that they have a soul. A fetus, on the other hand, is not 'unconscious' at every stage of the pregnancy. To be unconscious, you must  have a consciousness in the first place . Until a certain point, a fetus has no consciousness, therefore it is not 'unconscious'. It has no soul.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE TO ME THAT IT HAS A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   Of course your baby would do that, it was the size of a melon and had awareness despite being inside you still! It was human! But you know what? It wasn't human the second it's halves came together and fertilized.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THAT IT HAD A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   No. YOU are sad. You are the saddest sad person to ever be sad. You're the coldest thing to ever exist. My mother died in a car accident at the age of 73. We kept her body alive on life support for a week and pulled the plug after coming to terms with the fact that she was dead when her brain died.   You despicable c-... No, I'll stop from saying that insult. But you are despicable. Vegetable people are masses of meat without any consciousness. They are not comatose... they are not UNCONSCIOUS. They have NO CONSCIOUSNESS WHATSOEVER. I feel sad for you, being such a fool as to think that keeping a conscious-less piece of meat alive is right. To classify a conscious-less piece of meat as a human being is correct.  How about we classify severed limbs as people to, then huh? Then people won't ever be allowed to amputate their arms if they have leprosy. Instead they'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being.   I'd say screw you, but you know what... I don't need to. Your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are. A soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness.   PROVE TO ME THAT A SOUL CAN EXIST IN HUMAN FLESH WITHOUT IT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS.   Do it!   Because if you can't, you CANNOT prove me wrong and never will!, "}

{"span": "No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM   When did I say that wasn't the law. Do you read  anything  I type?    The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ€¦.she took the risk.   Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.    The sperm was a gift, he certainly canâ€™t ask for it back can he?   What? Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.   I believe personally that the man should be considered....   If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on  all grounds . Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by  law  then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?   Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said itâ€™s unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?  Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  Youâ€™re so ridiculous itâ€™s not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings    Didnâ€™t you call me a pig? Better reread that section   You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ€¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donâ€™t you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonâ€™t change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAINâ€¦â€¦â€¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ€¦.that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Donâ€™t you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnâ€™t he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ€¦this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what itâ€™s like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So donâ€™t tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said. I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ€¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ€¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâ€™s ovensâ€¦ pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.   Of course you will retaliateâ€¦you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   Youâ€™re so ridiculous itâ€™s not even funny. Bolongaâ€¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ€¦.not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ€¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ€¦â€¦â€¦   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?   So you donâ€™t like how I put thingsâ€¦â€¦..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.   No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.   I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth   Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to.   BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION   Good. If they were married like you stated he wouldn't be paying child support anyway.   Well you are wrong againâ€¦.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Elgin_Gill   128 days earlyâ€¦ or 21 weeks 5 days early    http://www.jillstanek.com/archives/2007/                                        02/worlds_youngest.htm   Actually she is. Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age. Why don't you produce a real argument?   There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.   For the final time read what I say. Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.   I know the information out thereâ€¦you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is  my  words. You ask for evidence you get it.   You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????   I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?, "}
