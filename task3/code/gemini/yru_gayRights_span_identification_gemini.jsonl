{"id": "gr1arg1", "span": "I've been reading the opposite side with a lot of interest and just like I expected, people have brought in a whole array of \"issues\" they have about homosexuality.   First I read about how the motives of the gay person are selfish   My response: WHO CARES? I see an old lady crossing the street. I help her cross over. Did I do it because I truly cared for her or did I do cause I wanted to feel good about myself? Does it matter? As long as I didn't help her because I wanted to steal her purse in the process then where is the harm???? So what if gays want to satisfy their parental instincts by caring for a child? How does that undermine the care and the love? Don't straight couples do the same? How many times have I heard straight couples saying that they will have children because that \"completes the family\", that they can't wait to be great mums or great dads. That's selfish too isn't it? But is it wrong? Hell no! I would be worried of someone didn't have that streak of selfishness in them. In my opinion, the people that make the best parents are the ones that wanted to be parents in the first place. Not just procreate, but BE PARENTS afterward. Here we have people that are begging to be parents and we're telling them \"you can't! we'd rather leave the kids in the orphanage than give them to you!\"   Then it's about how it is unnatural for them to become parents because by definition they would be required to do something that is unnatural for them    Right, so, should we exclude all infertile individuals from the right to adopt?  Because the above argument basically implies that inability to conceive/procreate equals inability to perform as a parent, because nature didn't want you to become one in the first place. Isn't that ridiculous? The fact that we have children in foster care proves that the ability to conceive/procreate does not equal the ability to become a parent. So the two are clearly not cross linked.   Then it's about how it is no one's right to adopt because the only person that has authority over a child is the biological parent - only they can \"appoint\" someone to look after their child   Someone actually used the word \"property\", the child is the property of the biological parents and no institution should ever have the right bypass them and give the child to someone else.   Since when are human beings \"property\"?  As a parent, all you have, is the responsibility to raise the child and provide for it. That's all you have. You don't posses a child. No one has possession of another human being, however young.   Now, I know for a fact that adoption agencies always look for people in the immediate or larger family that would foster the child. It's only when they have exhausted all those possibilities that the child is put up for adoption. In other words, no one in the family has offered to take over the responsibility! So it is then in the hands of the agency to find suitable parents from the general public. Let's be realistic, the family has absolved itself, or is not existent, or is mentally incapable. Now, I'm not saying everybody else then has the right to be their parent. But I think they do have the right to at least apply for the role, whether gay or straight.    But the child is going to be bullied!   Well, is that really an argument? If the kid is going to be bullied that's because the parents of the other children are bigoted and they have instilled that bigotry on their bully-kid. Kids are bullied everyday for being black, Muslim, Asian, tall, short, ginger etc etc. Does that mean we should take them away from their black, Muslim or ginger parents?   The reality is, these kids are spending their life in an orphanage. I find it funny how people who are otherwise unwilling to adopt them, think that they have the right to obstruct others who do. And they justify it with an array of bigoted crap. And all this time, those kids remain in the orphanage, when they could be in the hands of very loving, very caring, very responsible people who could give them a much better life, a much better education and much more to experience."}
