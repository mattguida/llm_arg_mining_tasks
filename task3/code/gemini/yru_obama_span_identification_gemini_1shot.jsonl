Where were these lard asses when there was a white guy in office?  2. Spending has actually been cut, and everyone conveniently ignored that Obama finally ended the f-22 program which Presidents have been trying to elimante but couldn't because they were not cool enough since Bush Sr. In fact Obama has passed 60% of cuts, much more than Bush Jr. - hence actually  shrinking  the size of government.  3.

reporting full information  1.Ended media blackout on covering the return of fallen soldiers to Dover AFB; the media is now permitted to do so pending adherence to respectful rules and approval of fallen soldier's family  1.The White House and federal government are respecting the Freedom of Information Act  1.Instructed all federal agencies to promote openness and transparency as much as possible  1.Limits on lobbyist's access to the White House  1.Limits on White House aides working for lobbyists after their tenure in the administration  1.Ended the previous stop-loss policy that kept soldiers in Iraq/Afghanistan longer than their enlistment date  1.Phasing out the expensive F-22 war plane and other outdated weapons systems, which weren't even used or needed in Iraq/Afghanistan  1.Removed restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research  1.Federal support for stem-cell and new biomedical research  1.New federal funding for science and research labs  1.States are permitted to enact federal fuel efficiency standards above federal standards  1.Increased infrastructure spending (roads, bridges, power plants) after years of neglect  1.Funds for high-speed, broadband Internet access to K-12 schools  1.New funds for school construction  1.The prison at Guantanamo Bay is being phased out  1.US Auto industry rescue plan  1.Housing rescue plan  1.$789 billion economic stimulus plan  1.The public can meet with federal housing insurers to refinance (the new plan can be completed in one day) a mortgage if they are having trouble paying  1.US financial and banking rescue plan  1.The secret detention facilities in Eastern Europe and elsewhere are being closed  1.Ended the previous policy;

Even if we differ in defintions of debt, and money flow, it has the same effect to the argument.   Then why did you bring it up in the first place?   I brought it up to say that he was forced to pay more, it was mandatory.   But if you're going to say that you don't like their economic views   In the simplest of terms, an economic system is simply nothing more than a system of allocation of resources, goods, and services. Pure capitalism cares only about the number of dollars you will put towards something. As there is not equality of opportunity, this is not fair, those on the bottom have less, and not only from their own actions. Those with money rule, the corporatism we have seen recently within US politics is arguably nothing more than the merging of politics and the free market. Those who do not have money deserve protection, they need food, water, shelter, and other similar necessities. Leaving them open to abuse by the rich is not what I think should happen, and that is what Libertarians would do - leave everyone to the benefits, and abuse, that others put on them through trade.  I love the idea of people being completely free to do what they want with their own money, their own time, their own labour, but people are not free, they are forced to work, they need an income to survive.   Not according to the evidence. The best you've got is that Republicans are blocking the Buffet rule   Which evidence? I seem to remember you posting a link that showed that Obama is being blocked from increasing any taxes  (the last few paragraphs) .   It's about getting government away from the banks all together.   Just like Iceland did? The government ended sold their state bank about ten years ago I believe, outside banks came in, made loads of money for a while, everyone was happy, but they were just part of the problem, put no safeguards in place, acted recklessly, and were destroyed in the recession. Now the prime minister is being put onto trial for gross negligence (the only head of state to be formally punished as part of the recession). It's worth remembering that the banks that did this were new to the country (all but one), they were not used to government involvement. They simply speculated, loaned out money, told everyone it was going fine, had massive rates of leverage, and then it all fell to shit.  So no, I don't agree that deregulating the banks is a good idea, either economically, or from a humanitarian sense (banks in many countries now refuse to lend to anyone those who need it, because they see it as 'high risk'. I understand taking a harsher tone on lending, but blocking off everyone, without considering them, is bad for people. They now only lend to businesses with capital to pay them back for sure).   A terrible one.   I'm sorry I trust bishops to stand up for the poor, it's not like they spend their life following a doctrine that tells them to do exactly that.  But in all honesty, I haven't read around it too much, and don't have time to do so now, however, it's not hard to find criticisms from other people in a better position to judge it than me."}

If the government decides stupidly to waste a billion dollars they should have that billion dollars in the first place, rather than to count on future taxation to provide them with the necessary funds. Ergo,  government spending must reflect taxes  (which ought never be high, or else they'll have a nearly infinite amount of money with which to traverse the world in search of demagogues to kill)."}

I can only give him credibility when he can guarantee that has sat down and read all 1000+ pages of the health care legislation he is pushing so intently.

Obama has not done this. He has not shown any effort in attempting to do this.  He is no more than a professional politician."}
