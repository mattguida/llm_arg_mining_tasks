{"span": "1.Taxes are the main gripe of all those fat pasty Tea Party weirdos. Yet this very year is the least taxes Americans have paid then at any time during the Bush administration. Where were these lard asses when there was a white guy in office?   Cutting taxes is something that just about any leader would do in a recession, its the future tax hikes to cancel out the huge deficits that people are pissed about.   2.  Spending has actually been cut, and everyone conveniently ignored that Obama finally ended the f-22 program which Presidents have been trying to elimante but couldn't because they were not cool enough since Bush Sr. In fact Obama has passed 60% of cuts, much more than Bush Jr. - hence actually shrinking the size of government.   $82.69 billion dollar deficits this April, though it is nice to see the military industrial complex get a kick in the balls.   3.

Here is a jobs chart link And that is actually off, we actually gained 200,000 jobs in January the most recent numbers indicate.   Keynesian economics: Fix something in the short run only to see it fail even more in the long run.   5. We are leaving Iraq, and we are doing better in Afghanistan since Obama took office now that we are actually concentrating on the terrorists responsible for 911 instead of chasing Cheyene's oil interests.  I oppose the war, but I'll give him credit for recent success.   And here's a list of things Obama has done, some may not agree with everything, but at least he isn't at Camp David or reading to Kindergartners on the tax payer's dime:   1.Ordered all federal agencies to undertake a study and make recommendations for ways to cut spending   Trying to make agencies more efficient is not a new concept.   1.Ordered a review of all federal operations to identify and cut wasteful spending and practices   See above.  1.Instituted enforcement for equal pay for women  I'll give him credit... though if women are to except maternity leave then they ought to expect lesser pay.   1.Beginning the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq  Good.   1.Families of fallen soldiers have expenses covered to be on hand when the body arrives at Dover AFB   McCain would have likely done something similar.   1.Ended media blackout on war casualties; reporting full information   Seeing as every tv station not named Fox is in the tank for him this is not much of an accomplishment.   1.Ended media blackout on covering the return of fallen soldiers to Dover AFB; the media is now permitted to do so pending adherence to respectful rules and approval of fallen soldier's family  Good.   1.The White House and federal government are respecting the Freedom of Information Act   Until what goes on behind closed doors with the Federal Reserve and Obama's negotiations with Unions and Democrats this is not much of an accomplishment.   1.Instructed all federal agencies to promote openness and transparency as much as possible   Really? They are counting this as an accomplishment?  1.Limits on lobbyist's access to the White House  I like this one.   1.Limits on White House aides working for lobbyists after their tenure in the administration  There are still loop holes but if this policy works I'll give him credit.   1.Ended the previous stop-loss policy that kept soldiers in Iraq/Afghanistan longer than their enlistment date   McCain might have done something like this, but I'll give Obama credit.   1.Phasing out the expensive F-22 war plane and other outdated weapons systems, which weren't even used or needed in Iraq/Afghanistan  1.Removed restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research   1.Federal support for stem-cell and new biomedical research   I don't mind stem-cell research, but tax payers should not pay for it.    1.New federal funding for science and research labs   Not their job to do so.  1.States are permitted to enact federal fuel efficiency standards above federal standards  I would respect this if he had a consistent record as to what the states are allowed to.  1.Increased infrastructure spending (roads, bridges, power plants) after years of neglect   1.Funds for high-speed, broadband Internet access to K-12 schools   Not government's job.   1.New funds for school construction   Not government's job, the schools still suck anyways.    1.The prison at Guantanamo Bay is being phased out   This one is just fucking retarded and is nothing more then a PR move. If he wants to change the prison's policies then that is one thing, but closing down a prison only to send the prisoners elsewhere is just stupid.    1.US Auto industry rescue plan   Propping up failing companies is not an accomplishment.    1.Housing rescue plan   He still needs to fix Fannie and Freddie.   1.$789 billion economic stimulus plan   The tax cut parts were good, the rest not so much.   1.The public can meet with federal housing insurers to refinance (the new plan can be completed in one day) a mortgage if they are having trouble paying   1.US financial and banking rescue plan   Not government's job.  1.The secret detention facilities in Eastern Europe and elsewhere are being closed  Good.  1.Ended the previous policy; the US now has a no torture policy and is in compliance with the Geneva Convention standards  Good   1.Better body armor is now being provided to our troops   McCain would have done the same.   1.The missile defense program is being cut by $1.4 billion in 2010  Good.   1.Restarted the nuclear nonproliferation talks and building back up the nuclear inspection infrastructure/protocols   New policy with new president, nothing special.   1.Reengaged in the treaties/agreements to protect the Antarctic  Protect it from what?   1.Reengaged in the agreements/talks on global warming and greenhouse gas emissions   More bull shit regulations from self righteous environmentalists.    1.Visited more countries and met with more world leaders than any president in his first six months in office   And now they like us more... so what?    1.Successful release of US captain held by Somali pirates; authorized the SEALS to do their job   Do you really think that a Republican would have hesitated to have the SEALS do their job?   1.US Navy increasing patrols off Somali coast   Do you really think that a Republican would have hesitated to increased military presence?    1.Attractive tax write-offs for those who buy hybrid automobiles   Preferential treatment to his environmental followers is not an accomplishment.    1.Cash for clunkers program offers vouchers to trade in fuel inefficient, polluting old cars for new cars; stimulated auto sales   Not the government's job, no way to pay for the program, Japan automakers love us now.  1.Announced plans to purchase fuel efficient American-made fleet for the federal government   1.Expanded the SCHIP program to cover health care for 4 million more children   Not government's job.   1.Signed national service legislation; expanded national youth service program   Not government's job.   1.Instituted a new policy on Cuba, allowing Cuban families to return home to visit loved ones   He could just lift the ban on Cuba altogether seeing as it hurts the Cuban people more then it hurts their government.    1.Ended the previous policy of not regulating and labeling carbon dioxide emissions   Not government's job.   1.Expanding vaccination programs   And wasting millions in the process on unused vaccines.   1.Immediate and efficient response to the floods in North Dakota and other natural disasters   MSNBC was criticizing the government for not doing anything, enforcing something like this after you are chewed out is not an accomplishment.   1.Closed offshore tax safe havens  Good.  1.Negotiated deal with Swiss banks to permit US government to gain access to records of tax evaders and criminals  Good.  1.Ended the previous policy of offering tax benefits to corporations who outsource American jobs; the new policy is to promote in-sourcing to bring jobs back  Good.  1.Ended the previous practice of protecting credit card companies; in place of it are new consumer protections from credit card industry's predatory practices  Good.   1.Energy producing plants must begin preparing to produce 15% of their energy from renewable sources   Not government's job.   1.Lower drug costs for seniors   Not government's job.  1.Ended the previous practice of forbidding Medicare from negotiating with drug manufacturers for cheaper drugs; the federal government is now realizing hundreds of millions in savings  Good   1.Increasing pay and benefits for military personnel   McCain would have done something similar.   1.Improved housing for military personnel   McCain would have done something similar.   1.Initiating a new policy to promote federal hiring of military spouses   McCain would have done something similar.   1.Improved conditions at Walter Reed Military Hospital and other military hospitals   McCain would have done something similar.   1.Increasing student loans   Not government's job, not only that but they have failed to address growing tuition costs which negates the benefits of increasing loans.  1.Increasing opportunities in AmeriCorps program  Ehhh, sure, I like this one.  1.Sent envoys to Middle East and other parts of the world that had been neglected for years; reengaging in multilateral and bilateral talks and diplomacy  Good   1.Established a new cyber security office   And now he wants the government to be able to take control of the internet in case of \"emergency\".   1.Beginning the process of reforming and restructuring the military 20 years after the Cold War to a more modern fighting force; this includes new procurement policies, increasing size of military, new technology and cyber units and operations, etc.   New president, new policy.   1.Ended previous policy of awarding no-bid defense contracts  Good   1.Ordered a review of hurricane and natural disaster preparedness   Sounds like something any president would do.   1.Established a National Performance Officer charged with saving the federal government money and making federal operations more efficient    1.Students struggling to make college loan payments can have their loans refinanced   Not government's job, if they really gave a shit then they would have fixed the problem of the rising costs of college, but seeing as the left is in love with academia I doubt that will happen.   1.Improving benefits for veterans   McCain.   1.Many more press conferences and town halls and much more media access than previous administration   Narcissism is not an accomplishment.   1.Instituted a new focus on mortgage fraud  Good.   1.The FDA is now regulating tobacco   Increasing the role of the nanny state is not an accomplishment.    1.Ended previous policy of cutting the FDA and circumventing FDA rules   Increasing the role of the nanny state is not an accomplishment.  1.Ended previous practice of having White House aides rewrite scientific and environmental rules, regulations, and reports  Good.   1.Authorized discussions with North Korea and private mission by Pres. Bill Clinton to secure the release of two Americans held in prisons   The reporters were not worth the costs.   1.Authorized discussions with Myanmar and mission by Sen. Jim Web to secure the release of an American held captive   Not worth the costs.  1.Making more loans available to small businesses  1.Established independent commission to make recommendations on slowing the costs of Medicare  Good.   1.Appointment of first Latina to the Supreme Court   I thought race did not matter to the left? Anyways, he appointed some bitch that he knew would agree with him on most issues, that is not an accomplishment that is politicizing the court, though that is nothing new.   1.Authorized construction/opening of additional health centers to care for veterans   McCain.   1.Limited salaries of senior White House aides; cut to $100,000   They should be making a lot less.   1.Renewed loan guarantees for Israel   Fuck Israel.   1.Changed the failing/status quo military command in Afghanistan   New president, new policy.   1.Deployed additional troops to Afghanistan   McCain.  1.New Afghan War policy that limits aerial bombing and prioritizes aid, development of infrastructure, diplomacy, and good government practices by Afghans  New president, new policy, but since this a really good policy I'll give him credit.  1.Announced the long-term development of a national energy grid with renewable sources and cleaner, efficient energy production   1.Returned money authorized for refurbishment of White House offices and   private living quarters   PR move.   1.Paid for redecoration of White House living quarters out of his own pocket   Really? Kos included this with accomplishments.    1.Held first Seder in White House   He threw a Jewish party? That's an accomplishment?  1.Attempting to reform the nation's healthcare system which is the most expensive in the world yet leaves almost 50 million without health insurance and millions more under insured  Already listed.   1.Has put the ball in play for comprehensive immigration reform   States are passing their own laws because they are tired of inaction at federal level.   1.Has announced his intention to push for energy reform   I wasn't aware that simply announcing a plan was an accomplishment. And since this is the Kos what they mean by \"reform\" is cap and trade that will cause electricity costs to sky rocket while at the same time allowing large companies to continue to pollute as long as they are willing to buy credits.   1.Has announced his intention to push for education reform   I wasn't aware that simply announcing a plan was an accomplishment.,"}

{"span": "But it is not spending, which actually creates debt.   If it's a red herring, and irrelevant to the economy, then are you saying that taxation doesn't matter? Even if we differ in defintions of debt, and money flow, it has the same effect to the argument.   Then why did you bring it up in the first place?   I brought it up to say that he was forced to pay more, it was mandatory.   But if you're going to say that you don't like their economic views   In the simplest of terms, an economic system is simply nothing more than a system of allocation of resources, goods, and services. Pure capitalism cares only about the number of dollars you will put towards something. As there is not equality of opportunity, this is not fair, those on the bottom have less, and not only from their own actions. Those with money rule, the corporatism we have seen recently within US politics is arguably nothing more than the merging of politics and the free market. Those who do not have money deserve protection, they need food, water, shelter, and other similar necessities. Leaving them open to abuse by the rich is not what I think should happen, and that is what Libertarians would do - leave everyone to the benefits, and abuse, that others put on them through trade.  I love the idea of people being completely free to do what they want with their own money, their own time, their own labour, but people are not free, they are forced to work, they need an income to survive.   Not according to the evidence. The best you've got is that Republicans are blocking the Buffet rule   Which evidence? I seem to remember you posting a link that showed that Obama is being blocked from increasing any taxes  (the last few paragraphs) .   It's about getting government away from the banks all together.   Just like Iceland did? The government ended sold their state bank about ten years ago I believe, outside banks came in, made loads of money for a while, everyone was happy, but they were just part of the problem, put no safeguards in place, acted recklessly, and were destroyed in the recession. Now the prime minister is being put onto trial for gross negligence (the only head of state to be formally punished as part of the recession). It's worth remembering that the banks that did this were new to the country (all but one), they were not used to government involvement. They simply speculated, loaned out money, told everyone it was going fine, had massive rates of leverage, and then it all fell to shit.  So no, I don't agree that deregulating the banks is a good idea, either economically, or from a humanitarian sense (banks in many countries now refuse to lend to anyone those who need it, because they see it as 'high risk'. I understand taking a harsher tone on lending, but blocking off everyone, without considering them, is bad for people. They now only lend to businesses with capital to pay them back for sure).   A terrible one.   I'm sorry I trust bishops to stand up for the poor, it's not like they spend their life following a doctrine that tells them to do exactly that.  But in all honesty, I haven't read around it too much, and don't have time to do so now, however, it's not hard to find criticisms from other people in a better position to judge it than me.,"}

{"span": "yet it's only gotten worse, from what I've heard.   His policies on the War on Drugs are even more authoritarian than Bush's.   Less taxing means more debt.   But it is not spending, which actually creates debt. Taxing is unnecessary to continue spending. Government will spend as much as it wants and will tax people as much as they want. We can't just say \"increase taxes to reduce debt\" when the debt could have been avoided all together. Once again, it's a red herring.   it largely falls outside of his mandate   Then why did you bring it up in the first place?  Bill Clinton, however, signed welfare reform. This was a Federal act.   I like this part of them, but disagree with others   yet you're not specific on how their economics will hurt anyone. You've avoided pointing to specific, first saying \"welfare is necessary\" and then saying \"well, Obama has no control over welfare.\"  Now, economics may not be your strong suit (it was once something i hardly considered), but if you're going to say that you don't like their economic views, you should be more specific on what is wrong with them.   Regardless, he's making an effort, and being blocked off, for no real reason   Not according to the evidence. The best you've got is that Republicans are blocking the Buffet rule, even though I already described how the Buffet rule is a \"red herring.\"   You wish to completely deregulate the banks?   It's about getting government away from the banks all together. The banks, how they currently operate, could not survive without government involvement. They rely on subsidies, standardized currency, human controlled inflation and regulation to keep themselves in power. Without it they would hold little power over our wealth and currency. Currently, the banks dictate most money powers. They will continue to dictate as long as government stays involved with the affairs of the banks. This isn't about letting the large trample the small, it's about removing the power-source for this monstrosity that government created in the first place. Big government is the problem here, not lack of it.   bankers operate in their own self interest, not in that of the bank, and not in that of the country.   A bank without government would NEED to operate in the interest of the consumers or else it will attract none. Currently people feel that they need banks. While the privatization of banks seemed like a good idea during the transitional period between Centralized and non-centralized banks, what ended up happening was government assisted greedy men. You can not expect the private sector to do what it does best if government is still involved, as it always has been. The banks are protected from competitive currency because they hold all currency rights. The banks are paid by governments to continue being banks, which removes most financial liability (especially when you're large enough to \"need\" a bailout). And the banks are encouraged by leaders (government bureaucrats like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) to make poor decisions but given money to make up for those poor decisions. This isn't some magical imbecile who happens to be running a bank, this is a guy basically being given money to make poor decisions with all of our money. It was inevitable with government involvement, as Ron Paul accurately predicted.   Remember that the heads of banks who brought about the recession got hundreds of millions of dollars, that sort of behaviour would only become more common,   Not if you eliminate government involvement in the banking market.   I was simply using them as an example.   A terrible one.   I have many complaints of Republican behaviour, and I can only imagine that this budget is just more of the same.   I'm sure you do, people complain a lot. The importance is substance, though.,"}
