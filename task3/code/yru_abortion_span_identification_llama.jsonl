This could ultimately cause you to loose consciousness all together so an automatic reaction is to wake up, itÃ¢s like a screensaver. -An unborn child has no reason; it has no choices to create over itself. No study has shown that an unborn child has ever been able to conduct its own decisions rather than its own instinctive actions.  -It has no emotion, no joy, sadness or pity. (For all your religious nuts out there, pain is not an emotion)  -Appetite is only created through its instinct to survive, I suppose it counts.  -Unborn children have no desire. They do not want anything but their instinct to, live, eat, and kick stomach every now and then. There is no aspiration or defining motive."}

Just because we judge doesn't mean we know. I know facts when I speak of my abortion ideas, but I do not know facts when I make opinions of you.  You're right, you don't need anyone to tell you right from wrong, but neither do I, because I don't have opinions about this, I know facts about this. That's what I base my morality on.   I don't care what the dictionary says. Use your own definition for a human being. What separates humans from most animals is that we have a self-aware consciousness, a soul. Some animals also do, but not all, but that doesn't mean we aren't still defined by our personality, consciousness, and soul.  Just because something is alive doesn't mean it's alive like a human. A mushroom is alive. Is is it wrong to step on a mushroom? No, it has no consciousness. A severed chicken leg has living cells (for a time after being severed), is it wrong to cook and eat it? No. It has no consciousness. What about a  human  finger? Is it by itself human because it has living cells (for a time)? NO. To say it is human for that reason is illogical idiocy.  Yes, humanity is measured by consciousness. You think the mentally retarded have no consciousness? They do. They feel and think and have a soul. People in commas are sleeping. For a long time. They think and feel and have a soul.   Vegetable people are not human. They brains are dead. They feel nothing, think nothing, and have no soul. Only their organs are alive and their brains have no function except to keep their life processes going. They are vegetables. Are vegetables people? No. The person they were died with their brains. So yes,  vegetable people are soulless piece of meat .  I know that a soul inhabits a body when something has a consciousness. We have machines to tell this. What  you  do not have is a machine that can show that a soul inhabits a body before something has a consciousness.   Abortion to purify races isn't right if that's the intent. But the act of the abortion at a stage before consciousness isn't wrong, the intent is wrong.   That intent is wrong in some cases, but only the intent, not if the act of the abortion is before the fetus is conscious.   Once again, the intent is wrong, but the act of aborting before the fetus is conscious isn't.  I'm all over on what? Abortion is right when the fetus isn't a human. Once it's human, it's wrong. What's complicated about that? I know when a fetus is human, I can prove it. You can't prove that fetus is human before it has a consciousness.   Yes, I do, you do not need to provide a link.  No, I did not say that, I gave it as an example of one of the extreme points. I've already said 3 or 4 times that I do not agree with either extreme point, I'm just on this side out of coincidence, and now because you're zealously pro-life.  No, my comments are morally logical and make plenty of sense. What you thought my comments said by mincing the words together inside your mind is what makes no sense. What is wrong with you?"}

The child would also have to grow up without a father. If the mother gave birth to the child in high school, she would have to drop out. The child will not be able to receive the full attention the child deserves from his mother if shes trying to take care of the child and study/work at the same time. It would be even worse if the father did not take responsibility like in some cases of teenage pregnancy. In other cases where women of any age are pregnant but are not prepared to take care of the child they give the child for adoption. The child would grow up in an orphanage without ever knowing his real parents. If the child is adopted, how would the child feel?

I am not familiar with the abortion issue in other countries and thus my arguments are concerning abortion in America only.   In America, the Supreme Court does not consider abortion to be murder. This is evidence by the fact that doctors who perform abortion in legal states are not arrested and charged with murder, and unless I am mistaken, the women who receive abortions, legal or not, are not arrested and charged with murder either.   What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries.    It doesn't matter to me whether or not abortion was first legalized because of a lie or that one of the involved parties was later arrested for anything. What matters to me is that abortion is a right women should have or continue to have, even if they became pregnant during consensual sex. My feelings on this are not based on any legal precedent.    You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life.    It ruled the fetus is  alive . Not that it is equal to  a human life . Bacteria, plants, and chickens are  alive  but they are not  human lives . Do you understand the difference? If the Supreme Court had ruled that fetuses are not just alive but also human lives, they would have no choice but to rule abortion as murder.
