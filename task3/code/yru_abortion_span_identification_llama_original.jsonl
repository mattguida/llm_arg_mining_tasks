The fetus might be small but nevertheless science says it is human and it is alive. What is it called when you take someones life without their permission? Isn't this murder? If you defend the womans choice to kill saying it is her choice....then should you enslave her by putting restrictions on when the killing takes place? Thus late term abortions should be legal if you are pro-abortion. When does her right to body sovereignty end?   I am all for the right of women to choose but when that choice kills another living human being that right should not exist. The living human growing inside her body is not part of her.

I don't care what the dictionary says. Use your own definition for a human being. What separates humans from most animals is that we have a self-aware consciousness, a soul. Some animals also do, but not all, but that doesn't mean we aren't still defined by our personality, consciousness, and soul.  Just because something is alive doesn't mean it's alive like a human. A mushroom is alive. Is is it wrong to step on a mushroom? No, it has no consciousness. A severed chicken leg has living cells (for a time after being severed), is it wrong to cook and eat it? No. It has no consciousness. What about a  human  finger? Is it by itself human because it has living cells (for a time)? NO. To say it is human for that reason is illogical idiocy.  Yes, humanity is measured by consciousness. You think the mentally retarded have no consciousness? They do. They feel and think and have a soul. People in commas are sleeping. For a long time. They think and feel and have a soul.   Vegetable people are not human. They brains are dead. They feel nothing, think nothing, and have no soul. Only their organs are alive and their brains have no function except to keep their life processes going. They are vegetables. Are vegetables people? No. The person they were died with their brains. So yes,  vegetable people are soulless piece of meat .  I know that a soul inhabits a body when something has a consciousness. We have machines to tell this. What  you  do not have is a machine that can show that a soul inhabits a body before something has a consciousness. "}

A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. When a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.   When the human embryo or fetus attaches to and invades the lining tissue of the mother's uterus, the lining tissue responds by surrounding the human embryo and does not cut it off from the mother, but rather establishes a means of close contact (the placenta) between the mother and the new human being.
