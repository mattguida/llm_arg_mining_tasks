In fact, it's been on display since he was a Senator. Also, his birth is recorded in history; on the date of Barack Obama's birth, his name was listed in the daily newspaper of his birth-town in Hawaii.   So he's American... unless you don't consider Hawaiians to be Americans, but you'd should probably keep that opinion to yourself.  And if you start spouting crap about it all being forged, then I'm afraid you are a sorry sorry fool who only wants an excuse to be racist.

Big government is the problem here, not lack of it. "}
