It would seem to be the more compassionate thing to protect humans who are more dependent on others for their existence. You protect the weak, not exploit or kill them.   It's still so very far from actually entering personhood.   I'm talking about human life, not personhood. Equivocating on terms is an attempt to ignore the obvious; were talking about human life.   I don't know where you get your definition   Oh I don't know, I just went to dictionary.com and got this definition and it doesn't discriminate on the basis of level of dependency like you do. What you call \"potential\" it calls life. In fact it makes no such distinction. Something is either alive or not. Also, I couldn't find a definition for potential life, only an article referring to it as a \"a clever rhetorical trick\" And since the parents of this life are human It's safe to say it's human. That ought to be obvious to any casual observer. Here is the standard definition of life;   the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms, being manifested by growth through metabolism, reproduction, and the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally.     we don't actually need to ban abortion cos doing that doesn't actually help   Banning abortion wouldn't stop the killing of over 1500 humans a day? I hope your kidding because of course it would. That's why we ban things, to stop them. And yes, that would most certainly help all those innocent humans.   your argument that abortion equals murder is complete crap.   Well, let's see. Something that was, by the standard definition of life, alive is now not alive, by the standard definition of life. So if something was alive we refer to it as dead. And that death came by willful intent, not an accident. In a court of law that's referred to as premeditated homicide. But since you can discriminate on the basis of level of dependency or level of development I guess that makes it OK, right ? I don't think so.

To prevent the birth of a child with birth defects or severe medical problems. Such defects are often unknown until routine second-trimester tests are done.5. Pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. 6. Physical or mental conditions that endanger the woman's health if the pregnancy is continued.

{"span": "The true cause of this 'burden' is the irresponsibilty of idiots which lead to elective abortion.   You know, this is actually a common thread amongst conservatives, especially the fundamentalists.  For example, they are against HPV and HIV vaccines and cures because they believe these diseases are deserved punishments for (in their view) immoral behaviour. They are against contraception because that removes the consequences they believe ought to follow from sex out of wedlock. They are against abortion because an unexpected newborn to them is some form of life lesson for (in their view) immoral behaviour and it is essentially punishment.  For the rest of us, I suppose that holding a person's future in your hands and choosing to ruin their lives as some sort of moral lesson designed to teach that the arbitrary morals held by a particular group are rules of nature, is frankly ghastly.   The second major issue I have with your distastefully anti human post is that you think a human being is only a human being after it has been born...that is scientifically speaking utter garbage...revealing a lack of understanding about human biology.   Just to set the record straight, I have no emotional issue with infanticide or homicide if it has a rational basis. Quite frankly, the newborn brain is still simple enough that I see no moral dilemma if the newborn must die for a rational reason. I set the ethical cut-off point at birth for the sake of convenience.   Creating an ultimate test of sentience and consciousness and then applying it to a large sample of foetuses as they mature and are birthed in order to definitively answer when a newborn has a mind capable of thought and awareness that we would call human is a task that is presently beyond us. Further it forgets that abortion is and always was the personal choice of the mother, since it is her body, and rationality dictates that an adult mind ought to have priority when compared to a developing mind.   Abortion is murder.  Pure and simple.  I am no christian incidently...my premise is entirely logical.   Murder is the unauthorised (illegal) killing of an individual. A foetus is not an individual (it has no sense of self or identity caused by unique memories), and it is not illegal to kill them. Therefore it is not murder.  Have you ever seen a foetus?, "}

In women who are promiscuous and take no time to learn about/use contraceptives, they should not use abortion as a Plan B.
