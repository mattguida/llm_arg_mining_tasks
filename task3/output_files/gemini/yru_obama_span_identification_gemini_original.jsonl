Bush is the equivalent of this in some measure, however insofar as his response to 911 and the crediting the wars, he made the situation worse, not that we should not have responded to the attacks but it was how we did it - shaving a bit off the constitution and committing to two ~10 year wars on borrowed money.   -Blaming Obama for how things are now is kind of like yelling at the person trying desperately to catch all of the shit flying off the fan after it hit and blaming him for missing a few of the pieces.-   Bush had to deal with the terrorist threat which was thrust upon him but i think that how he handled that was less optimal than how Obama has handled things since he took over. I am going to vote for him again in the coming election because he is our best chance and has done a good job thus far - just look at the job growth - the sluggishness of the markets and this effect on job growth and economic prosperity has nothing to do with him and his efficacy as a president - the conditions of our economic environment both domestically and internationally are the biggest influence in our slow recovery   Insofar as the economy goes, Bush didnt cause the collapse, but he did increase the national debt for these two not fully thought out wars (which we havent really won even though we have made some significant positive changes in the region).
